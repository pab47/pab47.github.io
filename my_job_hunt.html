     The pre-tenure move is different from moving to your first tenure track position in some not-so-obvious
     ways. Here are some pointers on what the search committee is most interested in pre-tenure
     applicants.

     <!--l. 52--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Deciding to move:</span></span>
     I had many reasons to move. The equipment startup was simply not sufficient for my growing ambitions
     to get into experimental research, difficulty in hiring good international students given the lower ranking,
     and difficulty in finding collaborators. Lastly, it did not help that my research did not align with the
     strategic research areas of the school; people working in the strategic research areas saw
     better collaboration opportunities, greater opportunities for fundraising, and better overall
     support.
     <!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >Some other reasons people move is because they want an increase in salary, unfavorable working
     conditions, difficult administrators, chair, or colleagues, dual-career issues. Occasionally faculty will get
     an offer from another school so that they can get a counteroffer (more toward the end on this
     topic) in the current school. Even if you don&#8217;t have any reason to move or to receive the
     counter-offer, going on the job market is a great way to calibrate yourself &#8211; if you get interviews
     that means you are competitive and if not, then you can change your research portfolio
     accordingly.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     <!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >If you feel that you are not being loyal in moving from one tenure track position to another, you do not
     need to feel so. First, you owe the university/college/department/faculty/students around you nothing
     and there is no obligation to stay if you don&#8217;t want to. Second, the colleagues/administrators around you
     have moved (some multiple times), so can you and people around you will not mind it eventually. Third,
     no matter what you told in the job interview about staying/working in the school, circumstances can
     change and you are not liable to what you said in good faith when you were interviewing. In summary, if
     you think this is a good move for you professionally (and personally), you should go on the job
     market.
     <!--l. 58--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Timing of the move:</span></span>
     When I started looking to move at the end of the 4th year, I was not worried about not getting tenure in
     my old university. That was because I had a favorable mid-tenure review and I had met the tenure norms
     that were informally communicated within the assistant professor inner circles. I had to my credit 22
     journals/conference papers, 7 MS students graduated, 3 PhD students in my advisements, and <span 
class="tcrm-1000">$</span>720<span 
class="cmmi-10">,</span>000
     in total funding that included <span 
class="tcrm-1000">$</span>650<span 
class="cmmi-10">,</span>000 credited to me; fairly good teaching evaluations
     and reasonably good service inside and outside the University. The fact that I got a sole
     investigator NSF award (my second sole investigator award) towards the end of my 4th year
     made my application particularly strong and it was perhaps the best time to go on the job
     market.
     <!--l. 60--><p class="noindent" >It is best to move when you can convince the search committee that you are on the path of research
     independence in multiple ways; you have funded grants, you have graduate students, you have published
     few papers <span 
class="cmti-10">without </span>your PhD/postdoc advisor but with your students. Although other things such
     as teaching and service are important they are usually never the deciding factor unless
     there are serious issues. Assuming you have publications with your graduate students, it is
     still best to go on the job market when you win a major research grant that is easy to
     transfer to the new university. It helps if this is a federal sole investigator grant and the
     federal agency has an established protocol on transferring grants. The best grant you can
     have when you want to transfer is probably the NSF CAREER because it is tied to the
     investigator and not the institution but other sole investigator NSF grants would also be
     great. If you don&#8217;t have sole PI NSF grants you should still figure out (discretely) if it
     is possible to transfer the grant. The reason I want to stress transferable grants is that
     having <span 
class="tcrm-1000">$ </span>that can move increases your chances of being viewed favorably by the search
     committee.
     <!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Thing to be aware of before you start on application materials:</span></span>
     First, preparing the application material, applying for jobs, interviewing, etc. will take time and energy
     and the last thing you want is a failed job search and an unproductive tenure track year. Second, even if
     you nailed the perfect job, moving pre-tenure will probably lead to loss of years towards tenure. That
     said, there was one institute where I was told that they would count all my years in the old
     university towards tenure in the new university. Sweet deal but I never got an offer from
     that school. Third, it goes without saying, <span 
class="cmbx-10">do not </span>tell your colleagues (unless this is a
     much-trusted friend) or chair or dean that you are on the job market; it is not going to help you
     especially if it so happens that you did not get any job offer. Fourth, when you go for the
     interviews, you will have to find people who will teach for you unless you cleverly schedule your
     interviews or classes (a much difficult task). Finally, be aware that because you thought
     you would be the best candidate for the position in the University, the search committee
     may not think so. Thus, your best bet is to apply wide and to as many positions as you
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     can.
     <!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-7000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Planning your research/grants the year you are on the job market:</span></span>
     You should strategize your research/grants preparation/submision the year you are on the job market to
     give you maximum leverage if you are successful in your job switch. For example, you might want to
     write papers and grants but not submit till you change your affiliation or use the time to explore a new
     research idea, etc.
     <!--l. 67--><p class="noindent" >In the year I was on the job market, I did not submit any new research grants. I used all my time to do
     research and write papers which I refrained from publishing. Once I moved to the new school, I quickly
     sent out the papers in quick succession.
     <!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-8000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Preparing the application material:</span></span>
     The application material is pretty standard. It includes a cover letter, a curriculum vitae, a teaching
     philosophy statement, a research statement, a list of 3 to 5 referees, and for some schools (almost all
     California state schools) a diversity statement. Since there are many resources on creating
     the application material, I will skip talking about this aspect. However, I would like to
     mention a few points: (1) the cover letter is very important and it will be read by the search
     committee so try to bring out the best in you in the cover letter (e.g., funding in bold); (2)
     include pictures/photos in your statements because that eases reading and to some extent
     helps your application to stand out; I had pictures/photos in my research and teaching
     statements and my curriculum vitae; (3) in your curriculum vitae include funding on the very
     first page (usually after your education or professional experience), the reason being that
     deans/chair who are extremely busy are most interested in your funding profile than other
     things; (4) have a good research website and indicate it in your application as some search
     committees will simply look at your website to help them assess your application. You could
     put a tracker on your website so you can see if there were hits on your website from the
     Universities you applied to. I have been using <a 
href="https://statcounter.com" >https://statcounter.com</a> and it has helped me to
     some extent in knowing the site traffic and correlating with the interviews/offers that I
     got. (5) You can submit the same cover letter (this is what I did) or write a customized
     letter (usually one custom paragraph) for each school, but remember it will take more
     time to write a customized letter. Finally, you could use your official school email for all
     communications or a personal email but do use your mobile number in your application
     (instead of office number) because there are chances that the search committee will decide
     to call rather than email and you do not want to be out of your office when the call is
     made.
     <!--l. 71--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-9000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Applying to schools:</span></span>
     I used only 2 websites to find faculty positions, <a 
href="https://higheredjobs.com" >https://higheredjobs.com</a> and <a 
href="https://academickeys.com" >https://academickeys.com</a>.
     The advert will indicate the open positions, the level (e.g., Assistant/Associate), the application
     materials required, how to apply (email/job portal) and the deadline. The application is mostly
     submitted through a weblink or in rare cases via email. I emailed two professors who I knew in two
     different schools that I was applying to and got phone interviews in both these schools. It most certainly
     helps if you know people in the schools you are applying to and make an effort to reach out to them after
     you apply.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     <!--l. 73--><p class="noindent" >Although I could have applied to Mechanical Engineering Departments <span 
class="cmti-10">and </span>Electrical &amp; Computer
     Engineering Departments, I consciously decided that I would only apply to Mechanical Engineering
     Departments. I applied to all Tier-1 schools irrespective of whether I would go/not go if I did get an
     offer. The rationale is that interviews with schools that you will not go even if you had an offer will
     provide you with some practice (phone as well as campus interview) so that you are much better
     prepared for the schools that you are most interested in. No, it is not unethical to do so. Also, getting an
     offer from a school could potentially be leveraged to solicit offers from other schools (more on this
     later).
     <!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" >It is always advisable to apply to the position as early as possible. That is, no need to wait for the
     deadline. This is because there is a high chance that the search committee chair is looking
     at applications more closely in the beginning because there are fewer applications. Also,
     sometimes the positions are filled on a rolling basis. This means that review/interview starts
     as the applications are received. That is, there is no specific deadline for the review to
     start.
     <!--l. 77--><p class="noindent" >Diversity and inclusion are very important topics in academic environments. Diversity refers to the range
     of people of different race, ethnicity, age, gender, religion, etc. that constitute the environment. Inclusion
     is providing a supportive and encouraging environment to everybody. It is best to have one
     paragraph in your teaching statement that addresses diversity and inclusion. It is very likely
     that the search committee has at least one member, usually a minority person, who is
     tasked to ensuring that the candidate are aware of diversity and inclusion in the academic
     environments.
     <!--l. 79--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-10000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Phone interview:</span></span>
     If the search committee likes your application be prepared to get an email to set up a phone
     interview date. The search committee will consist of 3 to 5 faculty members out of which
     one of them will be the chair of the search committee (not the chair of the Department)
     and occasionally one person outside the Department. Some of these people will be in your
     broad area (e.g., thermal, design, manufacturing) but not exactly expert in your research
     area(s). Feel free to ask the contact person (can be the chair of the search committee or the
     staff member who helps scheduling your interview) about the composition of the search
     committee if they have not already done so. This will help you to better prepare for the phone
     interview.
     <!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" >You can expect the phone interview to be either a regular phone chat (no video) or a skype /
     gotomeeting chat (with video). Most interviews are about 20 or 30 minutes but they can also be 45 min
     or 1 hour long. Be mindful about the time and stick to the allotted time else you will run out of time to
     answer the questions which might work to your disadvantage. Usually, phone interviews are scheduled
     back-to-back and the committee might have to cut you out before you can finish answering all questions.
     Ideally, you want to end a few minutes early to be able to ask questions that you might have about the
     position. Sometimes you will be told about the interview questions beforehand but most
     times not. I have found that there are normally 4 <span 
class="cmsy-10">- </span>5 questions (at least for the 20 to 30
     min interviews) and are pretty standard. The most common ones are variants of these
     questions.

     planning to move to another school and if you can transfer your grants. There is also a likelihood that
     you will be asked about how you ensure diversity and inclusion in the classroom and/or research, which
     is an important issue in academia. Occasionally, you might be asked how much startup and lab
     space you would need, a tricky question. You should avoid putting absolute <span 
class="tcrm-1000">$ </span>figure for the
     startup. It&#8217;s best to be vague; tell them what you would need but don&#8217;t put a <span 
class="tcrm-1000">$ </span>figure. Give a
     conservative number for the lab space (e.g., 700 to 1000 square foot for a decent experimental
     program). You only give the <span 
class="tcrm-1000">$ </span>figure once you get the verbal offer from the chair (more on this
     later).
     <!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" >My preparation for the phone interview was very algorithmic based on the list of questions mentioned
     earlier. I would first go to the Department website (and also to other related Departments websites) and
     find out whose research overlaps my research so that I may be able to collaborate. I would also research
     on each of the search committee members including their research areas, education, etc. I
     would also look into courses that I would be interested in teaching and also new courses
     that I might be able to develop. I would take a note of the course number; you will be
     amazed that faculty talk about courses by number, not so much by name. There is usually a
     definite purpose for the advertised position. Some common reasons are the Department wants
     to grow in the particular research area or hiring as part of a newly developing research
     group, replace a faculty member who left, etc. If you can find the reason in advance, you
     can emphasize how you fit the particular requirement during the interview, giving you an

class="cmbx-10">Campus interview:</span></span>
     If the search committee liked you, you should hear back either from the search committee chair or the
     department chair or a staff member about scheduling a time to get you on the campus for the in-person
     interview. The time between the phone interview and invitation for campus interview is usually less than
     a month. So if you don&#8217;t hear back within a month, you can assume (with high probability) that you
     were not selected for the campus interview.
     <!--l. 97--><p class="noindent" >The first thing is to decide a date for you to fly in (driving is viable if you are close proximity) for the
     campus interview. The main issue you will deal with (other than leaving your family for a few days) is
     that you might have to arrange someone else to teach your classes. Of course, you can schedule your
     interview so that you do not miss a class by having an exam on the day you are out of town (to be
     proctored by a teaching assistant). But this is often not the case. Here you might want to have a faculty
     friend to substitute for you but you should take him/her in confidence (it would not be correct to lie to
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     somebody who is helping you). In my case, I told a graduate student to teach my class in my
     absence.
     <!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" >The campus interview is usually 1 day long but sometimes 1<span 
class="cmmi-10">.</span>5 to 2 days. Depending on the
     availability of flights and timing of the interviews, be prepared to be out of town for 2 or 3 days.
     Before you leave, be sure to have the itinerary of your trip that includes all the faculty
     members, administrators, and laboratories that you are going to visit. Sometimes it is
     possible to request a meeting with a specific faculty member not in the itinerary (e.g.,
     outside the Department). Do your prior research on all the people you are going to meet and
     be ready with at least 1 (ideally more) questions for them. It is fine to repeat the same
     (important) question to multiple people because you will get a perspective on how people
     think (e.g., questions on tenure requirements or politics in the Department can be asked to
     multiple people). At any cost, do not ask about spousal hire or other non-standard things
     during the campus interview as those issues are best discussed after you have the coveted
     offer.
     <!--l. 102--><p class="noindent" >Some other logistic issues that are often overlooked. You will invariably take a personal
     item and a carry on baggage on the plane. Ensure that your flight allows you to carry
     2 pieces on-board. There are certain flights or certain fare categories (e.g., United basic
     fare) where the flight will charge you to take the carry-on bag <span 
class="cmti-10">and </span>a personal (laptop) bag
     onboard. If you are going to check-in your baggage, ensure that you have another set of formal
     dress and shoes in your carry-on just in case the checked-in bag does not arrive on time.
     You need to dress formally. At the minimum wear a formal shirt, pant, shoes, and a coat
     (tie is optional). Keep all your receipts so that you can then scan and send them to the
     Department to get reimbursed. A better option is to use a smartphone app (I recommend
     <a 
href="https://www.camscanner.com/" >https://www.camscanner.com/</a>; no need to take the paid version) to save scanned copies of
     the receipts on your phone or email them to yourself. Have your presentation on a thumb
     drive and on the cloud (e.g., Dropbox) beside your computer just in case. Finally, it is a
     great idea to sign up for frequent flyer programs with the airlines as you will not only
     accumulate points for all your faculty job trips (free points) but also subsequently as a
     Professor.
     <!--l. 104--><p class="noindent" >The campus interview is very standard. It involves a face-to-face meeting with at least one administrator
     at the College level (usually the dean or associate dean of research), the chair of the department, the
     faculty members, and sometimes graduate students and other personnel (e.g., laboratory
     instructors/managers/realtor). There is at least one lunch/dinner/breakfast with one or more faculty
     members and/or department chair. At the least, you will be asked to give a research talk for about 50
     minutes with 10 minutes for questions. Occasionally, you might be asked to give a teaching talk (10 <span 
class="cmsy-10">- </span>15
     minutes) or a future research/funding talk (10 <span 
class="cmsy-10">- </span>15 minutes) in addition to the research talk but is not
     common.
     <!--l. 106--><p class="noindent" >The research talk is the most important part of the interview and you can expect quite a few people
     showing up for the talk including graduate students. As a pre-tenure faculty with prior faculty
     experience, you are expected to not only present past research (as a PhD or postdoc) but also your
     current research that establishes you as an independent researcher. There is no hard and fast rule
     but you should be able to connect the things you have done in the past, to your current
     work, and how that leads to future work and funding. You should talk a little bit (<span 
class="cmmi-10">&#x00A0;</span>5 min)
     on seeking extramural funding and 1-2 slides on teaching at the least. Remember that as
     someone already on the tenure-track, the expectation is that you are not only an independent
     researcher but know how to navigate through funding, and this has to show up when you
     interview.
     <!--l. 108--><p class="noindent" >As you progress in the interview, try to make friends with at least one person (e.g., get to
     know her/him well). This person is going to be very helpful (perhaps giving you some
     insider information) but only once you have an informal offer from the department chair.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     This person might help you with negotiations, telling you what the department chair is
     thinking, etc. In my case, I was fortunate that in both my offers, the search committee chairs
     were particularly helpful (but only after I got the informal offer). Also, when you meet
     new assistant professors be sure to ask them about the startup packages and salaries (if
     this information is not publicly available). This will immensely help you during your offer
     negotiations.
     <!--l. 110--><p class="noindent" >Before you depart you might have an exit interview either with the chair of the department or with the
     search committee. This is your chance to provide them with the last moment clarification about your job
     interview (if you missed something), re-express your interest in the job, indicate if you have any other
     job offers and/or interviews coming up (but do not give specific details about the other job offers because
     it could work against you). Try to figure out when the last person will interview because that will give
     you a good sense of when the potential offer will be made. Also, after your research talk is
     over, feel free to ask the faculty members for feedback&#8212;it might help you in you in your
     next job interview; many faculty members are happy to give feedback, but only if they are
     asked.
     <!--l. 112--><p class="noindent" >Finally, after returning back home, it is a good idea to send short thank you email to some of the people
     you met. I sent thank-you notes to chairs, search committee members, and occasionally to some faculty
     members that I met.
     <!--l. 115--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-12000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Job offer:</span></span>
     Hopefully, you have a fair idea about when the last faculty candidate will interview (a question you could
     ask towards the end of your interview). Because this information can help you gauge when
     the offer will be made. It typically takes one week to one month for the top candidate
     to get the job offer. The negotiations typically last for one to two weeks per candidate.
     Thus, the second person on the list (assuming the first one did not take the job offer) can
     expect to get the offer in three weeks to 1<span 
class="cmmi-10">.</span>5 months. Of course, there are instances when the
     search committee may decide it did not like any candidate or liked only one candidate or
     other exceptions may apply. If you have offers from other schools then you should let your
     first-choice school know immediately. This works in your best interest to bump up your current
     offer.
     <!--l. 118--><p class="noindent" >I have found that most schools are not very particular about letting you know if they filled
     the position and/or you were not chosen. However, if they did let you know early, you
     could try asking the search committee (usually the chair) if she/he would be willing to
     give you feedback on your performance. Some others will tell you too late in the season
     (April or May or June) to be useful for your job search in the current year. Nevertheless, it
     is always good to ask for feedback. In my very first job hunt as a postdoctoral research
     associate in 2013, a search committee member told me that I had a few publications and
     that was important in their deliberations. Thus, I was able to bump up my publication
     the following year to get a tenure track job in the 2014 job cycle. For my most recent job
     hunt, the search committee of a school that I got a reject after campus interview, was
     kind enough to give me very detailed advice about my interview. This feedback came in
     mid-March, so I was able to use this valuable feedback in the last few schools I interviewed in
     April.
     <!--l. 122--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-13000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Negotiating the job offer:</span></span>
     The job offer consists of all the things you would be needing to be a successful professor in the new
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     school. The job offers includes, a salary (usually 9 month in academia), summer support for first two or
     three years, graduate student / postdoc support, reduced teaching load for the first few years, money for
     travel to conferences, moving allowances, and most importantly equipment and lab space (if you need the
     latter two).
     <!--l. 125--><p class="noindent" >The job offer will usually come via email or phone call from the Department Chair. The first thing the
     Department Chair would want to know is your equipment needs as this is the most variable part of
     the job offer. Because you are already a successful tenure track professor this is where
     you have a huge advantage as you would know what you need to be successful. You are
     expected to give an itemized list with costs and justification. I recommend adding another
     column indicating if the particular equipment would be useful to other faculty within the
     Department. That way it shows your intention to collaborate. Likewise, if there is a piece of
     existing equipment in the school you should put it in the list and indicate a cost of zero, thus
     showing that you are cognizant of current equipment in the school. The necessary information
     about available equipment is something you will have to figure out when you talk with
     the faculty members in-person during the campus interview. Its good to ask for a little
     more than you need. That is because there is a chance that your plans may change or
     there is better equipment available when you start so the extra money gives you some
     leverage. If you developed some custom-equipment or have specialized equipment in your
     current school and that is very specific to your research, you might be able to buy that from
     your current school at a reduced rate and take it to the new school. You should put your
     best guess estimate for buying the equipment (i.e., costs after depreciation and moving
     costs).
     <!--l. 127--><p class="noindent" >Once you provide your list of equipment to the chair, she/he will return either accepting your request or
     lowering the money you asked for citing his/her limitations. It is up to you to either negotiate back or
     accept the offer on the equipment. At this point (second email/call) the chair will also tell you about
     other things in the package such as 9-month salary, summer support, graduate student support, travel
     support, moving allowances, etc. Although all these things are mostly standard (salary takes into
     account your experience and current pay scales of faculty members), it is possible to negotiate all of
     them. However, I would only recommend negotiating a few of them but not all of them
     as this might send the wrong signals unless of course, the chair low balled you on all of
     them.
     <!--l. 129--><p class="noindent" >Your 9-month salary is an important financial remuneration for you. Because salary compounds through
     yearly merit raise, a higher salary means more money to you over the long run. For most public schools,
     salaries are posted online and may be searched. For private schools, you will have to either rely
     on the chair&#8217;s judgment or ask the faculty for more information. The summer support,
     graduate student support, and travel support are usually fixed for all incoming faculty
     but you could potentially negotiate one or more if you have very good justification. The
     moving expenses cover the cost for you and your family to move from your current school to
     the new school. This <span 
class="cmti-10">is not </span>the cost for house hunting and usually needs to be negotiated
     separately.
     <!--l. 131--><p class="noindent" >There are other things that you might need to negotiate. For example, a spousal hire either as faculty or
     other appropriate position in the University. Many schools do have a dual career hiring policy which may
     work well in your favor. Sometimes you may able to negotiate how many years of tenure track experience
     in your previous institution would be counted towards your tenure in your new school. Another issue, not
     faced by new tenure track faculty, is to negotiate the transfer of your PhD students to
     the new school (e.g., course credit transfer, qualifier exams, proposal/defense timeline).
     Such things are usually not on the offer letter so you have to negotiate them as well as get
     it in writing (personal email will do) so that you can bring them up as needed. At this
     point, it is also important to emphasize that it is best to do job offer negotiations using
     your personal email account so that you have a record of everything that was informally
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     communicated.
     <!--l. 133--><p class="noindent" >At this point, if you have not heard back from any other school, you can email them to let them know
     that you already have an offer. If you are a strong candidate in the other school they will likely come
     back quickly with an offer. You can then use the two offers against each other to get more of what you
     need.
     <!--l. 135--><p class="noindent" >Just remember that after you get the offer, it is expected that you will decide one way or the other in
     about 2 weeks unless there are exceptional circumstances (e.g., spouse interview). This is
     because most likely the school has other candidates in mind and they would like to move
     quickly, else they will end with a failed search. So be mindful that you cannot simply buy
     time.
     <!--l. 142--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-14000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Getting the counteroffer:</span></span>
     Once you have a job offer from an outside school, you can seek a counteroffer from your
     current school. A counteroffer is an offer made by your current school to keep you from
     taking an outside offer. While I did not seek the counteroffer, you might have reasons to do
     so.
     <!--l. 145--><p class="noindent" >Many schools have a policy on faculty retention (usually a handbook of policies and is usually
     available online). Besides reading that, you should also try to discreetly find out if your
     Department/College/University entertains a counteroffer and seek information about past
     cases.
     <!--l. 147--><p class="noindent" >Usually, you need a detailed offer (an unofficial email will do) to seek the counteroffer. When you go for
     the counteroffer you must be clear on what you are going to accept from your current school to stay.
     These could be things such as higher pay, spousal hire, equipment money, lab space, etc. Be mindful that
     in certain cases (e.g., you don&#8217;t have a competitive offer), your school will not give you
     a counteroffer. Also, a general rule is that you can seek a counteroffer only once in any
     school, so be strategic about the timing and external factors (e.g., the strength of your job
     offer).
     <!--l. 149--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-15000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">After accepting the offer:</span></span>
     Once you sign the paperwork from the new school and return it, you are officially set to move to a
     different school, which means you need to resign from your job at the current University. First of all, it is
     always a good idea to check the rules and regulation about faculty resignations in your (now)
     previous school. There are likely documents (e.g., handbook of policies) posted online. In
     my previous school, the handbook of policies was posted online and indicated that there
     was no notice period for faculty resignations (e.g., two weeks in most companies). But the
     only requirement was that faculty should resign at the end of the term (e.g., Fall, Spring,
     Summer) so that it does not affect the classes that you are teaching. Thus, technically
     you can resign as late as the beginning of the Fall term and be within the terms of the
     school. However, it is always a good idea to let the Chair know that you intend to resign
     as early as possible (but only after you sign the offer) about your intentions. This will
     give the Chair enough time to find a substitute teacher to teach the classes that you were
     assigned in the Fall and is a professional courtesy. In my case, I told the Department chair
     about 2 months before Fall classes started giving him ample time to find a replacement
     instructor.
     <!--l. 152--><p class="noindent" >Your graduate students (i.e., MS and PhD) are going to be affected by your decision too and you should
     let them know as soon as possible. In my case, I told my PhD and MS student immediately after signing
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     the job offer.
     <!--l. 155--><p class="noindent" >All three of my PhD students decided to move with me, two moved in Fall 2019 and one moved in Spring
     2020. A colleague&#8217;s PhD student also decided to come with me. Thus, I ended up getting 4 PhD students
     transferred to the new school. I had 4 MS students working on their thesis and I was able to graduate 3
     of them while the fourth transferred to another faculty and he graduated end of Spring
     2020.
     <!--l. 157--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-16000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Preparing the transition:</span></span>
     As you near the transition, there are a bunch of things to take care in your school (e.g.,
     graduate/transfer your students, taking care of teaching, etc.). The major one being submitting your
     resignation letter to the chair/dean. In the case of resignation letter be mindful about the resignation
     date because if you are getting paid in the summer, you might lose some pay if you resign too early. Also,
     you will lose access to your email so items such as pay stubs, grant information, etc. would need to be
     backed up before you lose access.
     <!--l. 160--><p class="noindent" >If you were planning to buy some of your custom-equipment from your old school then this is a good
     time to start the negotiations. Also, initiate the grant transfer after you have appropriate
     authorization in the new school. In my case, the new school processed an adjunct (no pay)
     appointment before my start date so I had an official email to initiate the grant transfer. If you
     have any dues in the old school including books do settle them as soon as you can. You
     might have to touch base with the human resources department to do any final paperwork.
     Such paperwork might include leave donations, getting health insurance during transition
     (known as COBRA), and giving your new address to get the tax documentation mailed to
     you.
     <!--l. 162--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-17000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Get a mentor:</span></span>
     I cannot emphasize this more, find a mentor (usually a professor in another school and not necessarily
     in your field of specialization) who is genuinely interested in your success and who can
     provide you with sound advice as needed. I was lucky enough to have a great mentor who
     provided vital advice at critical junctures that helped me get the best of the mid-tenure job

    talk. Then practise giving the talk using the script. Update the presentation and script as
    you practise. You might have to give the talk several times (10+ times) to emphasize on the
    important things, cut down on unnecessary stuff, and keep yourself within the time limits.
    Never exceed the time limit. Also, keep enough time for questions. The seminar time is
    usually about an hour. Your talk should be about 45-50 minutes, with about 10 minutes for
    questions and answers. The last part of your talk should be about future plans that include
    plans for teaching, research, funding, and collaborations.

class="cmbx-10">Startup package: </span>The startup package has two parts to it: (Part 1) The general part that
    is almost the same for all new hires which constitute your 9-month salary, your summer
    salary for the first and/or second summer, student support (Teaching Assistant (TA) and
    Research Assistant (RA)), course release in the first 2 or 3 years, travel to conferences, and
    moving expenses from your current location to the University; and (Part 2) lab space and
    equipment. For (Part 1) you probably have little negotiation power. You can change that
    a little, but not a lot. The RA support is typically 2 students for 2 years. Sometimes you
    may get additional TA support (e.g., 1 TA per semester for 2 years). For (Part 2), the lab
    space would depend on your research needs. For computational work, 300-400 square feet
    is good enough, for experimental work, 900-1200 square feet is reasonable. If you have the
    need for big equipment, you will have to negotiate for more. Just be mindful that space is
    always a constraint for most Universities, so try to be reasonable (e.g., sharing space with
    colleagues). The equipment depends on your requirements, but you should try to get the
    maximum possible for that University. That is because you might change your mind about
    what your research might be and/or there might be new or better equipment available by
    the time you are at the University. Perhaps you can ask for about 10%-25% more depending
    on your specific needs. This can be rolled into your negotiation as a warranty and/or cost
    of repairing the equipment.

class="cmbx-10">Things to do before leaving your current job: </span>Do not resign your current job, unless
    you have a signed offer from the University. The offer letter will typically have your signature
    and that of the chair or dean or provost of the University. Your resignation letter should be
    short. You could address it to the chair of the department or the dean of your college, saying
    that you are resigning your job on <span 
class="cmti-10">put a future date</span>. You could add another line saying
    addressing why you are leaving, but do not get into the details. For example, you could say
    you are leaving for personal and professional reasons. You do not need to state where you
    are going, either. Write the letter on a plain document, sign and date it, attach it to the
    email and send it across to the chair or dean. Do not write the letter on your letterhead.
    Ideally, use your personal email so you have the letter on record. Get all your pay stubs from
    the current job. The pay stubs are usually downloadable material. You never know if you
    would need them in the future. It is best to be safe than sorry. You will have to talk with
    the human resources (HR) department before you leave. The HR will ask you if you want
    extended health coverage between two jobs. This is known as COBRA. This is an expensive
    health coverage. Instead of taking this coverage, try to resign on a date where you will have
    some overlap between coverage between your old institution and the new one.

    <!--l. 187--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="cmbx-10">Whom and when to tell that you are leaving your job </span>You have to tell your higher
    up (the one you report to). This is usually the chair of the department. The best time to
    tell is after you have signed the letter (in case you do not want to go for the counter-offer),
    but at least one month before the start of the next semester. This way, the chair has enough
    time to find a replacement instructor for the course you were signed up to teach.

class="cmbx-10">Salary negotiation </span>The salary is the most important item you will be negotiating. This
    is because the salary will compound over time. Thus, if you start high, you will accumulate
    more wealth. For public universities, salary information is publicly available. You can use
    this information to negotiate a salary. For private universities, it is more tricky. You will
    have to either ask for faculty about their current salaries or make a guess on what is the
    approximate  salary.  You  could  use  the  salary  figure  from  a  comparable  university  in  a
    comparable city/town as a starting point. Remember that salaries are at least 5% higher
    than a comparable public university. If the chair comes with a figure, it is always possible to
    ask for up to <span 
class="tcrm-1000">$</span>5,000 more, politely. The worst thing that could happen is that they would
    say NO (because of constraints), but would not rescind the offer for asking. Do not say that
    you want more salary because of family/personal reasons. Your reasons should always be
    tied to your profession (e.g., star performer at your previous institute, CAREER awardee
    etc.).

class="cmbx-10">Negotiating for a post-doctoral student: </span>Young faculty are discouraged from hiring
    post-docs because they would like the faculty to work directly with students. However,
    some Universities are fine if new faculty ask for post-doc. The biggest advantage of hiring a
    post-doc on the startup is that the salary is not charged an overhead. That is, on a regular
    grant, with an overhead rate of say 50%, you have to budget 1.5 times the post-doc salary.
    If you absolutely need help to set up the lab, but the University does not support a post
    doc then you could try to ask for a technical assistant for a year or two, but this is more
    likely to be OK in the biology department than engineering.

class="cmbx-10">Transferring grants: </span>A grant can transfer when all encumbrances are zero. If you have an
    active grant, you are probably your students and/or have payments to be made for materials
    or equipments. This means that you have encumbrances. Once all payments are made, the
    encumbrances go to zero. You would then know how much money can be transferred and
    would be able to transfer the grant from one school to another. The method for transfer of
    grants is different for different agencies and you should check with the grants office of the
    institution you are going to. When you transfer the grant, you will have to redo the budget
    to account for the salary and overhead of the new institution. If you are moving to a better
    ranked school, the overhead, student salary, and your salary would be higher, which means
    the same amount of money will get you fewer person-hours. If you have not started using a
    grant, then you can initiate transfer as soon as your appointment at the new school starts. It
    is possible to create an adjunct appointment so that you can transfer grants earlier without
    having to wait for the end of the term (e.g., joining in Fall, but need to transfer a grant in
    Summer then an adjunct appointment starting in Summer would enable the grant transfer
    early).</li></ol>
