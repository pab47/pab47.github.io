							If you are a UIC undergrad or MS student and want to work on research in my Robotics lab (<a href="https://pab47.github.io" target="_blank">https://pab47.github.io</a>), please read this document in its entirety.
						</p>

						<p>
							Because of high demand, I cannot offer internships and/or research experiences for non-UIC students. If you are a high schooler, please see the last question in this document.
						</p>

						<ol>
							<li>
								<p><strong>I am an undergraduate/graduate student at UIC and want to meet you to discuss research opportunities in your lab.</strong></p>
								<p><strong>Ans:</strong> Thanks for considering working with me. I have been lucky to work with over 100 students over the past 10 years. You can read about their projects through documentation of their projects through one or multiple videos/presentations/code over here:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>(ugrad) <a href="https://pab47.github.io/alumni-undergrads.html" target="_blank">https://pab47.github.io/alumni-undergrads.html</a></li>
									<li>(grad) <a href="https://pab47.github.io/alumni-graduates.html" target="_blank">https://pab47.github.io/alumni-graduates.html</a></li>
									<li>(videos) <a href="https://pab47.github.io/videos.html" target="_blank">https://pab47.github.io/videos.html</a></li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									I get a lot of requests from students, most of them at the beginning of the semester, to request a research meeting. Early in my career, I used to meet with the student for 15–30 minutes and come up with a project for the student to get started. But as the semester got started and students started getting busy with HW, the interest fizzled, and I never heard from the students. I soon realized that this is not a worthwhile investment of my time to have a one-on-one meeting.
								</p>
								<p>
									Thus, I have stopped meeting with new students unless I know them from a class or prior work experience in the lab. If you are a new student who has never worked with me, this is what I propose. Look at the projects above in a) or b) or c). Find 2–3 projects that you liked and email me. I can then test your motivation by suggesting 1–2 projects. You can work on any of these projects (or even suggest one yourself) and send me your findings/progress via email as many times as you like. I will give you feedback and give you more tasks. Once I think you have done enough work, we can meet to find a more challenging and open-ended project for you.
								</p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<p><strong>Do you provide research experiences for high schoolers?</strong></p>
								<p><strong>Ans:</strong> I am not taking high schoolers at this time unless there is a tie-up between UIC and your school through some formal means (e.g., IMSA SIR summer program). However, I have some material that you can use to work toward a research experience, and email me your work. I am happy to assess it and provide feedback.</p>
