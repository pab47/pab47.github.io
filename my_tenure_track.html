     As a postdoc/PhD student, your job is to read literature, work on and write up your research, attend
     conferences and give talks, and on occasion, you might have to mentor undergraduate or newer graduate
     students. But as a faculty member your responsibilities increase several fold: you have to work on your
     research and generate new ideas, write papers and proposals including the budget, manage funded
     proposal ensuring that you are spending appropriately, hiring and advising graduate and undergraduate
     students through group and individual meetins, providing service to your community by reviewing
     papers, proposals, and to department committees, attending and giving talks at conferences, networking
     with other faculty, writing letters of recommendation, ordering lab supplies, and so on. But
     like the PhD/postdoc student, you have the same 24 hours and perhaps increasing family

     The tenure track clock is about 5 years, not 6 years. If you join in Fall (August) of Year 1, under normal
     circumstances (There are two exceptions: 1) You got a maternity leave for a semester or two, which will
     extend it by a year; 2) You started in Spring (January) instead of Fall, which will give you two extra
     semesters, Spring and Summer), you will submit your tenure package in Fall of Year 5 and submit
     recommendation letter writers to the Head of the Department in the Summer of Year 4. There will be at
     least one mid-tenure review, either at the end of Spring of Year 2 or Fall/Spring of Year 3. During
     the Fall of Year 6, your tenure package will undergo voting at various levels: first in the
     Department, then at the College, and then at the University, eventually making it to the
     President/Chancellor/Board of Regents for their approval. Most schools let you know the status
     of the vote at various levels. If you are successful, you will be promoted with indefinite
     tenure as an Associate Professor in the Fall of Year 7. If you are not successful, you will
     have a year, that is, from the Fall of Year 7 to the end of Spring Year 7, to find another
     job.

class="cmbx-10">&#x00A0;Rubrics for earning tenure:</span></span>
     You have to submit a tenure package at the end of year 5. This tenure package will be evaluated on a set
     of rubrics for research, teaching, and service. So let&#8217;s start with the end in mind. What are the
     evaluation rubrics?
     <!--l. 67--><p class="noindent" >Unfortunately, these rubrics are never quantitatively defined by the University. However, the rubrics are
     informally communicated within the Department circles. You could check this with the recently tenured
     associate professors or non-tenured assistant professors who are further ahead on the academic
     clock. For most research-intensive, mid-ranked Universities, the rubrics for securing tenure
     in Engineering are about the same. They are in the order of decreasing difficulty (in my
     opinion):
    <ol  class="enumerate1" >
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-4002x1">
    <!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" >Publish around 2 papers every year. In total, about 10 when you go up for tenure. The
    majority of these should be with your students.
    </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-4004x2">
    <!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >Win one federal grant as the Principal Investigator. Some may require another grant as a
    PI or co-PI.
    </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-4006x3">
    <!--l. 71--><p class="noindent" >Have at least one PhD student close to graduation.
    </li>
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-4008x4">
    <!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >Teach courses with an average rating close to that of your Department/College or average.
    </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-4010x5">
    <!--l. 73--><p class="noindent" >Be  on  at  least  one  Department  Committee  and  have  some  presence  in  your  research
    community.</li></ol>
     <!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" >In a nutshell, the point of the process is for the College/University to be able to judge your ability to run
     a sustainable research program (hiring students, raising money, writing papers), teach courses (thus,
     helping to generate tuition revenue), and provide adequate service to the Department and to your
     community.
     <!--l. 77--><p class="noindent" >If you changed jobs, that is, you moved from one University to another, it is highly likely that your
     research, teaching, and service contributions will not help toward the tenure rubrics. Thus, you would
     need to start from scratch unless you negotiated transferring some research credits to your new job.
     However, there are two exceptions: 1) If you are able to transfer your unspent grants to the new
     University from the old one, you will get full credit for the transferred grant. 2) If your graduate
     students are willing to move with you to the new University, then their coursework should
     transfer, provided you negotiated the transfer of students. Getting research-ready students to
     transfer will help you jump-start your research program and also help set up your new
     lab.

class="cmbx-10">&#x00A0;Planning your tenure track timeline:</span></span>
     It&#8217;s not only important to focus on what to do, but also when to do it. Here is an overview on the timing
     of these rubrics
    <ol  class="enumerate1" >
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5002x1">
    <!--l. 83--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline">Publications:</span> It takes six months to a year to formulate, solve, and write up a new project.
    It will take another six months to a year to get it published (i.e., resubmitted or accepted
    does not count). Thus, it takes at least a year (a conservative estimate) to get a publication
    out. Given that you need at least 2 publications per year, you need to be working on 2-3
    papers every year. This also means that you need to start publishing a sizeable number of
    papers early, in years 1 to 4, to enable papers to be published by the time you go up for
    tenure. Thus, expect to be busy working on research and publishing throughout the five
    years.
    </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5004x2">
    <!--l. 85--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline">Grants:</span> New faculty have startups which last for the 3 years or so. A standard startup will
    include monies for student support and equipment. Thus, you need to hit grants starting
    in year 3. A good strategy is to work on grant writing skills by attending workshops in the
    first two years, submit just enough proposals (say 3 <span 
class="cmsy-10">- </span>4) in those years, and peak in terms
    of quantity and quality of grants in years three and four. By focusing on research from year
    1, you are able to generate preliminary results to support your proposal ideas.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
    </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5006x3">
    <!--l. 87--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline">Hiring and Training PhD students:</span> New PhD students take mandatory coursework, which helps
    them prepare for the preliminary exam at the end of the first year. Thus, you can&#8217;t expect a new
    PhD to produce research products in the first year. It may take them their second year to produce
    publishable research. That means that you need to hire PhD students as soon as you can. But if you
    join in the Fall, you have a big disadvantage because you might have to wait till the
    following Spring to get your first PhD student. This implies that more realistically,
    you can get a publication from your first PhD students in year 3 onwards. But you
    cannot afford to wait to publish in year 3; that&#8217;s too late. Thus, you need to find a
    shortcut to be a research-active faculty member relatively quickly. Here are some
    ways
        <ol  class="enumerate2" >
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5008x1">
        <!--l. 89--><p class="noindent" >Hire MS students into your research group. MS students who have completed their
        coursework can be relatively quickly turned into research-productive graduate students
        compared to new PhD students. Try to solicit MS students in your major to join your
        research group by paying them tuition and/or stipend
        </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5010x2">
        <!--l. 90--><p class="noindent" >Hire research productive MS students into the PhD program. Ask other professors to
        recommend their MS students. These students have completed their coursework and
        have some experience with research. This will boost your research productivity very
        quickly. You could also hire PHD students who are looking to move from one group to
        another, but be careful about this choice as these students could
        </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5012x3">
        <!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" >Send out unpublished work from your PhD and postdoc for publication. You might have
        some results from your PhD or postdoc that need a bit of analysis and writing to turn
        into publishable work. Get these out in the first two years.
        </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5014x4">
        <!--l. 92--><p class="noindent" >Hire postdocs. It is rare for beginning investigators to hire postdocs, but if this is viable,
        then it can help boost productivity in the first two years. But remember that postdocs
        are generally twice as expensive as PhD students.</li></ol>
    </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5016x4">
    <!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline">Teaching:</span> As a new faculty, you will get a course release for the first 2 to 3 years. For example, if
    the regular course load is 3 courses per year, then you will teach two courses in the first 3 years and
    3 courses per year after that. In the 5 years leading up to the tenure, expect to be asked to teach
    at least 4 unique courses, one of which would be a graduate course in your field of
    expertise. For undergraduate courses, try to stick to courses that are close to your
    research field. Also, teaching core classes with prescribed texts and question banks is
    easier than teaching elective courses with no prescribed texts, as these require you to
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
    develop your own notes from reading multiple sources. Try to stagger new courses so
    you develop only one new course per year and stick to these courses till you earn
    tenure.
    </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5018x5">
    <!--l. 97--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline">Service:</span> You are required to provide some minimal service to your Department and to your research
    community in order to earn tenure. Your goal is to find the threshold and stick to it for the 5 years.
    Choose a Department committee that requires minimal effort on your part (2-3 meetings
    in the semester). My favorites are the Seminar committee, which meets 1-2 times
    per year to solicit external speakers for the Department seminars, and the Awards
    committee, which meets once per year to decide teaching/service awards. Service to
    your research community could be done by reviewing a few (2-5) papers per year
    and/or serving on proposal panels, which also helps you to learn about the review
    process.</li></ol>

class="cmbx-10">5.</span><span 
class="cmbx-10">&#x00A0;Making it easier to complete your tenure package:</span></span>
     At the end of the five years (and sometimes for the mid-tenure review), you will have to submit a
     package, usually in a PDF format, in which you will have to document all things you have
     done.
     <!--l. 104--><p class="noindent" >It&#8217;s easy to forget your contributions unless you keep track of these things as they are achieved. I
     recommend three specific things. (1) Capture your achievements in your CV. If it&#8217;s too much work to
     constantly update the CV, then I recommend capturing these achievements in a text file (e.g., on the
     desktop) and updating the CV once per month. (2) Capture the papers/proposals/review invitation,
     etc., on your computer. I recommend creating a folder on your computer, say &#8220;my_tenure&#8221;. Within
     that, create folders for every academic year and within that keep documents pertaining to
     grants, papers, teaching review, and service. (3) Understand what is expected in the tenure
     package as early as possible. The tenure package documents are available on your University
     website. Skim through the tenure requirement package to understand what things need
     to be captured. You will be amazed at how many details are needed. For example, for
     teaching, you are expected to keep track of the number of students who signed up for the
     course, the number of course evaluations you got, and your course evaluation rating. For
     advising, you are also supposed to keep track of the number of PhD/MS committees that
     you served on, including the names of the PhD/MS candidates and sometimes the title
     of their thesis. Such things are tedious to track if you don&#8217;t capture them at the right
     time.

class="cmbx-10">6.</span><span 
class="cmbx-10">&#x00A0;Writing proposals:</span></span>
     Writing proposals and winning grants is the hardest requirement because: 1) the success rate on federal
     grants is very low, <span 
class="cmsy-10">~ </span>5 <span 
class="cmsy-10">- </span>20%, 2) new faculty don&#8217;t have experience writing grants. The solution to 1) is
     to write as many quality grants as possible while maintaining a decent research portfolio, and 2) is to go
     through some formal grant writing workshop or books to learn about the tricks of grant
     writing.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     <!--l. 109--><p class="noindent" >Although it is expected to win at least one federal grant, it is a good idea to write other
     local, state, or industry-related proposals, at least in the early stages of your career. This
     exercise gives you some practice to tackle the harder, longer, and more competitive federal
     grants.
     <!--l. 111--><p class="noindent" >I highly recommend the workbooks by Grant Writers Seminars and Workshop
     <a 
href="https://www.grantcentral.com/workbooks/" >https://www.grantcentral.com/workbooks/</a>. They have workbooks that are specific to the agency NIH,
     NSF, DoD, etc. Assuming that you have a good idea for a proposal, these workbooks help to lay out
     your research ideas in a convincing manner. That is, assuming you have identified a gap in
     knowledge in your field and have an idea to close the gap, the workbook helps you craft a good
     story.
     <!--l. 113--><p class="noindent" >A federal grant is about 15 <span 
class="cmsy-10">- </span>20 pages, and it is speculative. That is, you are going to propose
     things that you are going to do over 3 to 5 years. But you also need some preliminary
     work to support your studies. The preliminary work can come from your past published or
     unpublished work. The preliminary work is usually a simulation study or a small subset of
     experiments that you are proposing. It is important to keep this in mind while performing your
     research.
     <!--l. 115--><p class="noindent" >Assuming you have a great idea and preliminary work to support your proposed research, I recommend
     that you start writing at least 2 months before the grant deadline. Also, try to write 1 <span 
class="cmsy-10">- </span>2 hours every
     day. If you can write 0<span 
class="cmmi-10">.</span>5 to 1 pages per day, you can get the proposal ready in 30 days. This gives enough
     time to improve the grant and work on other things, such as collaboration letters and the budget. It is
     also important to read the Request for Proposal and additional documents (e.g., budget, current
     and pending funding, equipment, data sharing, mentoring plan, collaboration letters) and
     other guidelines (e.g., nature of letters collaboration versus support letter for NSF, page
     limits) thoroughly as minor mistakes can lead to your proposal being returned without
     review.

class="cmbx-10">&#x00A0;Structuring your grant applications:</span></span>
     To make tenure, you need to win at least one federal grant as a Principal Investigator. But the catch is
     that if you win a grant, you cannot stop writing proposals. This will look questionable on your CV.
     Thus, you have to keep writing proposals to demonstrate that you are continually putting in the effort to
     raise money to support your research. Also, given the low success rate in funding, it is important to
     submit many proposals.
     <!--l. 121--><p class="noindent" >So, how do you keep a steady stream of proposals going out, given that writing a proposal can be a time
     sink? Note that not all proposals are the same. This is the most important fact that you can exploit to
     diversify your portfolio. For example, NSF proposals are limited to 15 pages, some state-level proposals
     might have a proposal template, and many Department of Defense submissions require you to write a
     white paper that can be 2 to 5 pages long. Thus, in any given year, you can mix the types of
     grants and agencies you apply for funding. You can also resubmit rejected proposals after
     improving them. You could also collaborate with another PI to help reduce the writing
     load.
     <!--l. 123--><p class="noindent" >As an early-career-faculty (The definition of early career faculty varies. One definition is based on
     terminal degree, e.g., 10 years from the PhD degree. Another one is by the job, e.g., untenured Assistant
     Professor) you have access to special programs e.g, NSF CAREER award, DoD Young Investigator
     Program (YIP) that give you a smaller pool to compete with. These are prestigious grants, and getting
     these awards could potentially lead to tenure if other aspects of your package meet the minimum
     expectations. Sometimes your University/College might have internal grants to help early-career faculty.
     These grants are small, but they help you get started with fundraising and generating preliminary
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     data for external proposals. There are some programs that depend on the designation of
     your University, e.g., HBCU, MSI, EPSCoR. There are certain opportunities called limited
     submissions, which means that only a set number of applications may go out from the specific
     institute. These usually involved an internal competition, but they would have a smaller
     competition pool if you succeed at the University level. As an early career faculty, it is best to
     avoid submitting for large, multi-university, multi-PI opportunities and equipment grants
     unless there are special circumstances (e.g., research cannot be done without a specific
     instrument).

     The normal expectation is that you publish 2 papers per year in journals/conferences in your field. While
     the time to acceptance in conferences is generally shorter, 3-6 months, journals can take 6 months to a
     year or more for the first decision. Also, in some of the more traditional fields in engineering, conference
     papers are not counted as full papers. This means that based on your field, you have to
     factor the time needed from submitting to publication in the conference proceedings and/or
     journals.
     <!--l. 130--><p class="noindent" >As you are starting the tenure track position, it is important to send out papers soon. It is a good idea to
     use your PhD/postdoc work as a basis for these papers. To count as a publication, your affiliation
     on the paper should be your current institution. Also, as you are working on setting up
     your lab and hiring new students, it is important to send out a steady stream of papers.
     This can be done by resorting to theoretical/simulation work if that is possible. If you are
     into experimental work, there is no other way other than to set up your lab quickly and
     perhaps do the experiments yourself, as it takes a year or two for the graduate students to be
     productive.
     <!--l. 132--><p class="noindent" >The initial few years are the hardest because you have to not only set up your lab, but also write
     proposals, and hire students. It&#8217;s best that you don&#8217;t take any risky projects but focus on relatively safe
     projects, which would likely lead to publishable work. Keep the risky projects for later, possibly after

     Having a successful PhD student as you go up for tenure is sometimes a norm for earning tenure. Here
     &#8220;success&#8221; usually means that the student has at least presented and passed the thesis proposal, which
     indicates that the student is well on the way to a PhD degree.
     <!--l. 137--><p class="noindent" >A good student can be a multiplier, which just doubles or triples your output for research, but a
     problematic student can be a time sink. Thus, it is important to recruit good students to your group.
     This is something that comes from experience, and everybody whom I know has failed to some extent, so
     don&#8217;t overthink, but go by your instinct. Some of the tips are: try to hire alumni from schools that have
     been successful in your program, connect with friends/colleagues in other schools and ask them to
     recommend their students, hire undergraduate students at your institution, and groom them to be your
     future students. For the first and/or second graduate student in your group, you might
     have to spend extra time teaching them how to develop niche skills needed in your area of
     research.
     <!--l. 139--><p class="noindent" >Many times, students are confused about what they are expected to do in the PhD studies. They need
     some rubrics (just like you do for your tenure) to be able to work toward. One academic rubric set by the
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     Department is that students should maintain an adequate GPA and pass the preliminary exam. Beyond
     that, it is your job to provide realistic research expectations to the student by creating
     appropriate rubrics, which might be field-dependent. The rubrics for getting a PhD in my lab are
     straightforward: publish three technical papers in a journal/conference by the time you
     graduate. To help plan the paper submission, the timeline is as follows. During their thesis
     proposal exam (1 year before defense), they should have paper 1 accepted and paper 2
     submitted or close to submission. During their thesis defense, they should have papers 1
     and 2 accepted and paper 3 submitted or close to submission. The criteria for getting a
     technical publication are that the work should push the field by introducing a new idea
     and supporting it with theoretical and/or experimental work, which naturally meets the
     criterion for a PhD. Having three novels would lead to three chapters of a PhD thesis.
     These three chapters, along with an introduction chapter and a conclusion chapter, are
     adequate for a PhD thesis. Since technical papers have gone through a peer review by
     experts in the field, the chances of a student failing the PhD exams are usually minimal
     if they have good publications. For a Master&#8217;s student, the rubric could be 1 technical
     publication to be accepted/submitted/work in progress by the time they appear for the Thesis
     defense.
     <!--l. 141--><p class="noindent" >These rubrics need not be set in stone and should be modified based on the career goals of the
     students. For example, if a PhD student is seeking a teaching position after graduation,
     they may want to focus on improving their teaching skills rather than research skills; if a
     PhD student is seeking an industry position they might want to have a more hands-on
     project that may have more depth and qualify as only a single paper; a Masters student may
     not be interested in having publications at all. This latter point, the fact that Master&#8217;s
     students have limited time and may not be able to produce publications, might deter you
     from signing up Master&#8217;s students for your group. But on the upside, there is also the
     possibility that the Masters might be interested in continuing into the PhD with you. Thus,
     you might have to gamble on hiring a Master&#8217;s student into your group as a beginning
     investigator.

class="cmbx-10">&#x00A0;Teaching:</span></span>
     Teaching courses to graduate/undergraduate students is a primary requirement even in
     research-intensive schools. The course load is usually 2 to 4, depending on your research load.
     Many elite Universities (usually called R1 or with very high research output) will have only
     a 2 course per year workload, usually state or small private universities (usually called
     R2 or high research output R3 with moderate resaeach output) will have 4 courses per
     year, and those in between, other R1 and some R2 with a relatively high research demand
     will have 3 courses per year load. New faculty will get 1 course release for the first 2 or 3
     years. You could also buy out courses anytime by adding the cost of cost release to your
     grants.
     <!--l. 147--><p class="noindent" >Irrespective of the University you work for, whether a very high research or moderate research
     institution, bad teaching will definitely sink any hopes of getting tenure. However, good teaching is not
     generally rewarded with tenure. Hence, aspire to be an OK teacher who gets close to average or above
     Department average ratings, but not any more. The time you save by being an OK teacher should be
     utilized for research, including paper and proposal writing, and working with your graduate students to
     make them independent.
     <!--l. 149--><p class="noindent" >It is usually easier to teach core (mandatory) classes with well-established textbooks. These textbooks
     help immensely in creating notes for teaching and questions/answer keys that can be used for setting up
     homework and exams. Your goal is to put some effort into teaching the course the first time and then try
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     to use that momentum to teach it without using too much time to prepare for it. Thus, it&#8217;s
     important that you teach the course a couple of times to justify the effort it took to create the
     course.
     <!--l. 151--><p class="noindent" >Teaching graduate courses and technical electives in your field of expertise can be gratifying. It can also
     help to train the students on the research skills needed to be successful in your lab. But this should be
     done later in your tenure years, as it can be significantly time-consuming. Also, courses with a lab
     component can be challenging, and if you have to develop labs as part of the course, that can be a whole
     semester lost to teaching. Be wary of such commitments.
     <!--l. 153--><p class="noindent" >One of the most time-consuming and least enjoyable aspects of teaching is grading. It&#8217;s best to get
     graders or teaching assistants to help with them. If possible, check if the textbook publisher has
     computer-generated problems that are automatically graded by software. There are also automated
     grading software such as <a 
href="https://gradescope.com" >https://gradescope.com/</a> that enable efficient grading and seem to be
     available in many Universities. This software works best with multiple-choice questions
     and, more generally, where students submit the final answer in a box that can be read
     using OCR and graded for accuracy. Try to maximize these kinds of problems in your
     exams.
     <!--l. 155--><p class="noindent" >The easiest way to get a poor rating (and many instructors make this mistake) is not having clear
     grading rubrics. Use the syllabus to set up clear rubrics for grading (e.g., 20% for homework, 40% for
     project, and 40% for exams) and indicate in detail your class policies for each of these items, such as
     deadlines for homework, project expectations, due dates, etc. Post the syllabus in a prominent place
     where students can download and read it. This is usually the website Blackboard or Canvas for most. At
     any cost, don&#8217;t change the rubrics midway in the course, but follow them closely. Don&#8217;t introduce
     a different grading system or cancel exams. It will not help. If you anticipate changing
     anything, put a clause in the syllabus that gives you the authority to change, but this
     practice is best avoided. The only time I had to make major changes was during COVID, but
     other than that, I have stuck to the rubrics I set in the syllabus at the beginning of the
     semester.

     All faculty members are supposed to do some service toward their community and school. However, as a
     tenure-track faculty, you are often given a role to serve on a Department committee. If you have a choice,
     find a committee that does as little work as possible. One example is the seminar committee, whose job
     is to solicit seminar speakers from faculty and coordinate the visit. Another one is the awards
     committee, where your job is to meet at the end of the semester or year to decide who will get
     the teaching/, research, and/or service awards. It is highly advisable to avoid being on
     time-consuming committees such as undergraduate/graduate committees or accreditation
     committees.
     <!--l. 161--><p class="noindent" >You are also expected to do some service toward your research community, such as reviewing papers,

     One of your responsibilities is to write letters of recommendation for students who took your courses or
     worked with you on research and/or thesis. It is up to you to agree or disagree to write
     such letters. I usually don&#8217;t say &#8216;No&#8217; to any student who did reasonably well in one of the
     courses with me and who asks me for a letter. A recommendation letter needs to be on the
     Department/College/University letterhead and needs your signature. The body contains a generic
     statement about the nature of your recommendation (strong/not strong), a paragraph introducing
     you (or you could make this a footer on the last page), and 2 or 3 paragraphs about the
     person for whom you are writing the letter. Letters for students who were in your class
     and with whom you had minimal interaction can be short, but letters for students who
     worked extensively with you and produced papers or salient outputs tend to be longer.
     If you can&#8217;t say anything good about the student, you should refrain from writing the
     letter.
     <!--l. 166--><p class="noindent" >These letters can become a time sink. But here are some general ideas that might help you speed up the
     process of writing these letters. I save all my letters in folders (e.g., internship, graduate studies,
     postdoc) so that I can reuse parts of the letters. For students (graduate and undergraduate) who have
     just had a class with me and did reasonably well, the letters are short. These don&#8217;t take much time to
     write. For students who have been involved in a more intense research experience with
     me, the letter is more detailed with concrete examples on how their work is novel and/or
     interesting.
     <!--l. 168--><p class="noindent" >Ask your colleagues to give you the letterhead they use for recommendation letters. You can then
     customize it as needed (e.g., some headers might require you to add your contact details). You should
     also have a soft copy of your signature that you can embed in the letter without having the need to print
     it out and then sign it by hand. Avoid sending the letter to the students, but directly submit it to the
     admission portal (for grad applications) or the contact person (for postdoc applications and
     internships

     At the end of 5 years, you will have to give the names of potential letters for your tenure application.
     Ideally, you should give about 3 to 5 potential letter writers. It&#8217;s a good idea to email these people and
     ask them if they would be comfortable writing a letter for you before you give their names. The
     Department head will only pick 2 or 3 from your list, but will seek 2 or 3 additional letter writers in your
     research area.
     <!--l. 173--><p class="noindent" >These letter writers have to be full professors in schools that have a reputation as strong as your current
     school or stronger. However, these people cannot be your advisors and co-authors on papers or proposals.
     Associate professors are generally not recommended. Also, full professors in a different country
     (even if the University there is ranked higher than yours) is not recommended because they
     may not be aware of the norms and criteria in your school/country for tenure. You can
     also indicate people who should not write letters for your tenure case; this is optional.
     These could be people who have strong disagreements with your work or have personal
     biases.

     ways of finding full professors: introduce yourself to them at conferences, invite them to your school to
     give a seminar, and organize workshops with them. Also, do not submit papers or proposals
     with potential letter writers because that would disqualify them from writing a letter for

     Besides running your research group, you have the important task of continuing to use your
     startup/grant monies to pay for students and buy equipment. I highly recommend that you never
     delegate this activity to anyone, as poor management of funds can lead to catastrophic effects on your
     ability to support the research activities in your lab.
     <!--l. 182--><p class="noindent" >If you are an experimentalist who needs equipment to get started in your research, it is your top priority
     to get the equipment as soon as possible. If the equipment is expensive, typically greater than 100<span 
class="cmmi-10">,</span>000,
     and if you are in a public institution, it could take almost a year to get the equipment because of the
     number of approvals needed at various stages, so plan accordingly. If you are into computational work, I
     highly recommend staggering the purchase of computers/graphical processing units, other electronics,
     over the period of a few years to avoid having outdated computing resources. I keep track
     of all items (ever) purchased in a simple text file so that even if the lab is disorganized,
     I can still check my notes to see if an item was ever purchased. Another strategy is to
     collect a list of items that you are seeking over time and batch order them, thus saving
     shipping costs, as many vendors will offer free shipping if your orders are above a certain
     threshold.
     <!--l. 184--><p class="noindent" >There are many aspects of purchasing that you will learn as you work with the system. Here are a few.
     Most Universities are non-profit and hence tax-exempt. That means they do not pay taxes on purchases.
     There is a tax-exempt form that can be used to purchase items without paying taxes. You
     can use this form if you are buying something for the lab and want to get reimbursed.
     The startup money usually has an expiry time, so you want to factor that in during your
     purchases. There is money that accrues to you when you get grants through the overhead.
     Sometimes the College/Department might provide you with incentives to get more of this
     money if you do special duties (e.g., support senior design projects, teach an extra course).
     This money sits in a separate account and never expires, and it is a great way of &#8220;saving
     for a rainy day&#8221;. Some other funds, such as NSF research experiences for undergraduates
     (REU), can only be used to fund undergraduates who are US citizens or US permanent
     residents.

class="cmbx-10">&#x00A0;Running the research lab:</span></span>
     Running a research lab has its own challenges. You have to meet with students at least once per week to
     assess their progress and to provide feedback. Some people prefer a one-on-one meeting while others
     prefer a group meeting. We use the latter. We have a shared Google Slides show, one for each week. Each
     student puts slides that talk about the work they did in the last week and the work they plan to do in
     the next week. The online nature of the slideshow enables us to do a virtual or in-person meeting
     and/or record the meeting if needed. During the meeting, one person (usually the PI)
     opens the slideshow and shares it with others using screenshare. The students present their
     work one after the other, and the listeners give comments. The meeting has a variable
     end time that depends on when all the students are done with their presentations. This
     ensures that everybody has enough time to present their work, and we are not rushed by
     time. The virtue of having a group meeting is that if one student is stuck, it is possible to
     give collective feedback that is often better than that provided by a single person, the PI.
     The students have also found that forcing them to put their ideas on a slideshow every
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     week helps them to prepare for presentations as they can recycle the slides and/or get
     practice. Students often volunteer to give a practice talk before a conference and/or thesis
     presentation.
     <!--l. 189--><p class="noindent" >The group meeting is the single most important tool that has helped me keep my lab productive. Besides
     research projects, we also talk about other important items such as writing and reading papers, lining up
     conference papers/deadlines, tools to help productivity, etc. Since the lab meeting is important, we never
     cancel it, but move it a day early or back as needed. But we do break for 2 weeks at the end of the year
     (i.e., in December). I avoid keeping the lab meeting on Mon or Fri because those are holidays if it is a
     long weekend.
     <!--l. 191--><p class="noindent" >We have also found that it is important to have an instant messaging service for the lab. This is often
     used as a means for asking others for help (e.g., I cannot find the drill in the lab or I need a certain
     special wire, do we have it in the lab?) to sharing interesting ideas and resources. We have tried using
     the free version of Slack, but it deletes all history after 90 days. We have moved to Microsoft
     Teams, which is provided for free by the University. We can now use many of the Teams
     features, such as Meetings, Calendar, and integration with online Excel, to manage the lab
     meetings.
     <!--l. 194--><p class="noindent" >Maintaining the lab research website is an important item. This is how you will get an undergraduate
     and graduate students interested in your work. You can check my lab website here: <a 
href="tiny.cc/ramlab" >tiny.cc/ramlab</a>. Note
     that I am using a URL shortener. The advantage of the shortened link is that if I change the domain of
     the website, I can change the underlying link without having to change the shortened URL. If you skim
     my lab website, you will see that I keep track of publications, funding, and lab alumni. I think these are
     the three most important items on a lab website. I also have a &#8220;videos&#8221; page that has lots of research
     outputs in terms of videos. This eye candy helps to attract new students by giving them visual
     information that is easy to process. I update the website about 3 times per year, once after
     each term, Fall, Spring, and Summer. This is the reason why I don&#8217;t have a &#8220;News&#8221; page,
     which needs constant updating. I maintain an &#8220;undergraduate alumni&#8221; page on which
     I have put reports/code links with the specific research experience (e.g., Senior Design,
     Undergraduate Research). This kind of information sharing helps future students who might want to
     understand the type of projects done in the lab. The &#8220;Contact&#8221; page not only gives the
     address to my lab, but also parking and navigation information. This is very helpful if you
     want to tell a visitor where you are located without the need to type it out every single
     time.

     You should strive to keep your CV up-to-date. This is the single most important document that will help
     you track your important achievements. The CV is sent out to your letter writers, and it might also be
     used in tenure decisions by your Department/College/University. The CV, if structured properly,
     can dramatically help the letter writers to write compelling letters and the committee
     members to vote in support of granting you tenure. Besides the standard experience/education
     items, you can make it easier for them by including items that they can use to check off on
     the list of rubrics to earn tenure that I described earlier. Here are some of the important
     considerations.

     remain as tenured Associate Professors. Unfortunately, such professors are always given
     the most hated service jobs, such as chairing the accreditation committee, which has a
     lot of work. If you like this path, then go for it. If not, continue working hard like you
     did for your tenure and get promoted to a full professor in a couple of years; it&#8217;s worth
     it.
