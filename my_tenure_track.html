class="cmbx-10">Differences between a postdoc/PhD student and a faculty member:</span></span>
   As a postdoc/PhD student, your job is to read literature, work on and write up your research, attend conferences
and give talks, and on occasion, you might have to mentor undergraduate or newer graduate students. But as a
faculty member your responsibilities increase several fold: you have to work on your research and generate new
ideas, write papers and proposals including the budget, manage funded proposal ensuring that you are spending
appropriately, hiring and advising graduate and undergraduate students through group and individual meetins,
providing service to your community by reviewing papers, proposals, and to department committees, attending and
giving talks at conferences, networking with other faculty, writing letters of recommendation, ordering lab supplies,
and so on. But like the PhD/postdoc student, you have the same 24 hours and perhaps increasing family
responsibilities.
<!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a

class="cmbx-10">Tenure Timeline:</span></span>
   The tenure track clock is about 5 years, not 6 years. If you join in Fall (August) of Year 1, under normal
circumstances (There are two exceptions: 1) You got a maternity leave for a semester or two, which will extend it by
a year; 2) You started in Spring (January) instead of Fall, which will give you two extra semesters, Spring and
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
Summer), you will submit your tenure package in Fall of Year 5 and submit recommendation letter writers to the
Head of the Department in the Summer of Year 4. There will be at least one mid-tenure review, either at
the end of Spring of Year 2 or Fall/Spring of Year 3. During the Fall of Year 6, your tenure package
will undergo voting at various levels: first in the Department, then at the College, and then at the
University, eventually making it to the President/Chancellor/Board of Regents for their approval.
Most schools let you know the status of the vote at various levels. If you are successful, you will be
promoted with indefinite tenure as an Associate Professor in the Fall of Year 7. If you are not successful,
you will have a year, that is, from the Fall of Year 7 to the end of Spring Year 7, to find another
job.
<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a

class="cmbx-10">Rubrics for earning tenure:</span></span>
   You have to submit a tenure package at the end of year 5. This tenure package will be evaluated on a set of
rubrics for research, teaching, and service. So lets start with the end in mind. What are the evaluation
rubrics?
<!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >   Unfortunately, these rubrics are never quantitively defined by the University. However, the rubrics are informally
communicated within the Department circles. You could check this with the recently tenured associate professors or
non-tenured assistant professors who are further ahead on the academic clock. For most research-intensive,
mid-ranked Universities, the rubrics for securing tenure in Engineering are about the same. They are in the order of
decreasing difficulty (in my opinion):
     <ol  class="enumerate1" >
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-4002x1">
     <!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >Publish around 2 papers every year. In total, about 10 when you go up for tenure. The majority of
     these should be with your students.
     </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-4004x2">
     <!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" >Win one federal grant as the Principal Investigator. Some may require another grant as a PI or coPI.
     </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-4006x3">
     <!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" >Have at least one PhD student close to graduation.
     </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-4008x4">
     <!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >Teach courses with an average rating close to that of your Department/College or average.
     </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-4010x5">
     <!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >Be on at least one Department Committee and have some presence in your research community.</li></ol>
<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >In a nutshell, the point of the process is for the College/University to be able to judge your ability to run a
sustainable research program (hiring students, raising money, writing papers), teach courses (thus,
helping to generate tuition revenue), and provide adequate service to the Department and to your
community.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >   If you changed jobs, that is, you moved from one University to another, it is highly likely that your research,
teaching, and service contributions will not help toward the tenure rubrics. Thus, you would need to start from
scratch unless you negotiated transferring some research credits to your new job. However, there are two exceptions:
1) If you are able to transfer your unspent grants to the new University from the old one, you will get full credit for
the transferred grant. 2) If your graduate students are willing to move with you to the new University, then their
coursework should transfer, provided you negotiated the transfer of students. Getting research-ready
students to transfer will help you jump-start your research program and also help set up your new
lab.
<!--l. 59--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-5000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Planning your tenure track timeline:</span></span>
   Its not only important to focus on what to do but also when to do it. Here is an overview on timing of these
rubrics
     <ol  class="enumerate1" >
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5002x1">
     <!--l. 62--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline">Publications:</span> It takes six months to a year to formulate, solve, and write up a new project. It will
     take another six months to a year to get it published (i.e., resubmitted or accepted does not count).
     Thus, it takes at least a year (a conservative estimate) to get a publication out. Given that you need
     at least 2 publications per year, you need to be working on 2-3 papers every year. This also means
     that you need to start publishing a sizeable number of papers early, in years 1 to 4, to enable papers
     to be published by the time you go up for tenure. Thus, expect to be busy working on research and
     publishing throughout the five years.
     </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5004x2">
     <!--l. 64--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline">Grants:</span> New faculty have startups which last for the 3 years or so. A standard startup will include
     monies for student support and equipment. Thus, you need to hit grants starting in years 3. A good
     strategy is to work on grant writing skills by attending workshops in the first two years, submit just
     enough proposals (say 3 <span 
class="cmsy-10">- </span>4) in those years, and peak in terms of quantity and quality of grants in
     years three and four. By focussing on research from year 1, you are able to generate preliminary results
     to support your proposal ideas.
     </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5006x3">
     <!--l. 66--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline">Hiring and Training PhD students:</span> New PhD students take mandatory coursework, which helps them prepare
     for the preliminary exam at the end of the first year. Thus, you can&#8217;t expect a new PhD to produce research
     products in the first year. It may take them their second year to produce publishable research. That means
     that you need to hire PhD students as soon as you can. But if you join in the Fall, you have
     a big disadvantage because you might have to wait till the following Spring to get your first
     PhD student. This implies that more realistically, you can get a publication from your first PhD
     students in year 3 onwards. But you cannot afford to wait to publish in year 3; that&#8217;s too late.
     Thus, you need to find a shortcut to be a research-active faculty relatively quickly. Here are some
     ways
         <ol  class="enumerate2" >
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5008x1">
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
         <!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" >Hire MS students into your research group. MS students who have completed their coursework
         can be relatively quickly turned into research-productive graduate students compared to new PhD
         students. Try to solicit MS students in your major to join your research group by paying them
         tuition and/or stipend
         </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5010x2">
         <!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" >Hire research productive MS students into the PhD program. Ask other professors to recommend
         their MS students. These students have completed their coursework and have some experience
         with research. This will boost your research productivity very quickly. You could also hire PHD
         students who are looking to move from one group to another, but be careful about this choice as
         these students could
         </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5012x3">
         <!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >Send out unpublished work from your PhD and postdoc for publication. You might have some
         results from your PhD or postdoc that need a bit of analysis and writing to turn into publishable
         work. Get these out in the first two years.
         </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5014x4">
         <!--l. 71--><p class="noindent" >Hire postdocs. It is rare for beginning investigators to hire postdocs, but if this is viable, then
         it can help boost productivity in the first two years. But remember that postdocs are generally
         twice as expensive as PhD students.</li></ol>
     </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5016x4">
     <!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline">Teaching:</span> As a new faculty you will get a course release for the first 2 to 3 years. For example, if the regular
     course load is 3 courses per year then you will teach two courses in the first 3 years and 3 courses per year
     after that. In the 5 years leading to the tenure, expect to be asked to teach atleast 4 unique
     courses, one of which would be a graduate course in your field of expertise. For undergraduate
     courses, try to stick to courses that are close to your research field. Also, teaching core classes with
     prescribed texts and questions banks are easier than elective courses with no prescribed texts as
     these require you to develop your own notes from reading multiple sources. Try to stagger new
     courses so you develop only one new course per year and stick to these courses till you earn
     tenure.
     </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5018x5">
     <!--l. 76--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline">Service:</span> You are required to provide some minimal service to your Department and to your research
     community in order to earn tenure. Your goal is to find the threshhold and stick to it for the 5 years.
     Choose a Department committe that requires minimal effort on your part (2-3 meeting in the
     semester). My favorites are the Seminar committee that meets 1-2 times per year to solicit external
     speakers for the Department seminars and Awards committee that meets once per year to decide
     teaching/service awards. Service to your research community could be done by reviewing a few (2-5)
     papers per year and/or serving on proposal panels which also helps you to learn about the review
     process.</li></ol>
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Making it easier to complete your tenure package:</span></span>
   At the end of the five years (and sometimes for the mid-tenure review), you will have to submit a package,
usually in a PDF format, in which you will have to document all things you have done.
<!--l. 83--><p class="indent" >   It&#8217;s easy to forget your contributions unless you keep track of these things as they are achieved. I recommend
three specific things. (1) Capture your achievements in your CV. If it&#8217;s too much work to constantly update the CV,
then I recommend capturing these achievements in a text file (e.g., on the desktop) and updating the CV once per
month. (2) Capture the papers/proposals/review invitation, etc., on your computer. I recommend creating a folder
on your computer, say &#8220;my_tenure&#8221;. Within that, create folders for every academic year and within that keep
documents pertaining to grants, papers, teaching review, and service. (3) Understand what is expected in the
tenure package as early as possible. The tenure package documents are available on your University
website. Skim through the tenure requirement package to understand what things need to be captured.
You will be amazed at how many details are needed. For example, for teaching, you are expected to
keep track of the number of students who signed up for the course, the number of course evaluations
you got, and your course evaluation rating. For advising, you are also supposed to keep track of the
number of PhD/MS committees that you served on, including the names of the PhD/MS candidates and
sometimes the title of their thesis. Such things are tedious to track if you don&#8217;t capture them at the right
time.
<!--l. 85--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-7000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Writing proposals:</span></span>
   Writing proposal and winning grants is the hardest requirement because: 1) the success rate on federal
grants is very low, <span 
class="cmsy-10">~ </span>5 <span 
class="cmsy-10">- </span>20%, 2) new faculty don&#8217;t have experience writing grants. The solution to
1) is to write as many quality grants as possible while maintaining a decent research portfolio, and
2) is to go through some formal grant writing workshop or books to learn about the tricks of grant
writing.
<!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >   Although it is expected to win at least one federal grant, it is a good idea to write other local, state, or
industry-related proposals, at least in the early stages of your career. This exercise gives you some practice to tackle
the harder, longer, and more competitive federal grants.
<!--l. 90--><p class="indent" >   I highly recommend the workbooks by Grant Writers Seminars and Workshop <a 
href="https://www.grantcentral.com/workbooks/" >https://www.grantcentral.com/workbooks/</a>.
They have workbooks that are specific to the agency NIH, NSF, DoD, etc. Assuming that you have a good idea for a
proposal, these workbooks help to lay out your research ideas in a convincing manner. That is, assuming you have
identified a gap in knowledge in your field and have an idea to close the gap, the workbook helps you craft a good
story.
<!--l. 92--><p class="indent" >   A federal grant is about 15 <span 
class="cmsy-10">- </span>20 pages, and it is speculative. That is, you are going to propose things that you
are going to do over 3 to 5 years. But you also need some preliminary work to support your studies. The preliminary
work can come from your past published or unpublished work. The preliminary work is usually a simulation study
or a small subset of experiments that you are proposing. It is important to keep this in mind while performing your
research.
<!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   Assuming you have a great idea and preliminary work to support your proposed research, I recommend that you
start writing at least 2 months before the grant deadline. Also, try to write 1 <span 
class="cmsy-10">- </span>2 hours every day. If you can write
0<span 
class="cmmi-10">.</span>5 to 1 pages per day, you can get the proposal ready in 30 days. This gives enough time to improve the grant and
work on other things, such as collaboration letters and the budget. It is also important to read the Request for
Proposal and additional documents (e.g., budget, current and pending funding, equipment, data sharing, mentoring
plan, collaboration letters) and other guidelines (e.g., nature of letters collaboration versus support letter for
NSF, page limits) thoroughly as minor mistakes can lead to your proposal being returned without
review.
<!--l. 97--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-8000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Structuring your grant applications:</span></span>
   To make tenure, you need to win atleast one federal grant as a Principle Investigator. But the catch is that, if
you win a grant, you cannot stop writing proposals. This will look questionable on your CV. Thus, you have to
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
keep writing proposals to demonstrate that you are continually putting in the effort to raise money to
support your research. Also, given that the low success in funding, it is important to submit many
proposals.
<!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >   So how do you keep a steady stream of proposals going out given that writing a proposal can be a time sink?
Note that, not all proposals are the same. This is the most important fact that you can exploit to diversify your
portfolio. For example, NSF proposals are limited to 15 pages, some state-level proposals might have a proposal
template, and many Department of Defense submission require you to write a white paper that can be 2 to 5 pages
long. Thus, in any given year, you can mix the type of grants and agencies you apply for funding. You can also
resubmit rejected proposals after improving them. You could also collaborate with another PI to help reduce the
writing load.
<!--l. 103--><p class="indent" >   As an early-career-faculty (The definition of early career faculty varies. One definition is based on terminal
degree, e.g., 10 years from the PhD degree. Another one is by the job, e.g., untenured Assistant Professor) you have
access to special programs e.g, NSF CAREER award, DoD Young Investigator Program (YIP) that
give you a smaller pool to compete with. These are prestigous grants and getting these awards could
potentially lead to tenure if other aspects of your package meet the minimum expectation. Sometimes your
University/College might have internal grants to help early career faculty. These grants are small but they
help you get started with fund raising and generating preliminary data for external proposals. There
are some program that depend on the designation of your University, e.g., HBCU, MSI, EPSCoR.
There are certain opportunities called limited submissions which means that only a set number of
application might go out from the specific institute. These usually involved an internal competition,
but they would have a smaller competition pool if you succeed at the University level. As an early
career faculty it is best to avoid submitting for large, multi-university, multi PI opportunities and
equipment grants unless there are special circumstances (e.g., research cannot be done without a specific
instrument).
<!--l. 107--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-9000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Writing papers:</span></span>
   The normal expectation is that you publish 2 papers per year in journals/conferences in your field. While the
time to acceptance in conferences is generally shorter, 3-6 months, journals can take 6 months to a year or more for
the first decision. Also, in some of the more traditional fields in engineering, conference papers are not counted as
full papers. This means that based on your field, you have to factor the time needed from submitting to publication
in the conference proceedings and/or journals.
<!--l. 110--><p class="indent" >   As you are starting the tenure track position, it is important to send out papers soon. It is a good idea to use
your PhD/postdoc work as a basis for these papers. To count as a publication, your affiliation on the paper should
be your current institute. Also, as you are working on setting up your lab and hire new students, it is important to
send out a steady stream of papers. This can be done by resorting to theoretical/simulation-work if that is
possible. If you are into experimental work, there is no other way other than to setup your lab quickly
and perhaps do the experiments yourself as it takes a year or two for the graduate students to be
productive.
<!--l. 112--><p class="indent" >   The initial few years are the hardest because you have to not only setup your lab, but also write proposals, and
hire students. Its best that you don&#8217;t take any risky projects but focus on relatively safe projects, that
you would likely lead to publishable work. Keep the risky projects for later, possibly after earning
tenure.
<!--l. 114--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-10000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Recruiting and Training PhD students:</span></span>
   Having a successful PhD student as you go up for tenure is sometimes a norm for earning tenure. Here &#8220;success&#8221;
usually means that the student has atleast presented and passed the thesis proposal which indicates that the student
is well on the way to a PhD degree.
<!--l. 117--><p class="indent" >   A good student can be a lever, that just doubles or triples your output for research but a problematic student
can be a time sink. Thus, it is important to recruit good students to your group. This is something that comes from
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
experience and everybody whom I know has failed to some extent so don&#8217;t overthink but go by your instinct. Some
of the tips are: try to hire alumni from schools that have been successful in your program, connect with
friends/colleagues in other schools and ask them to recommend their students, hire undergraduate students at your
institution and groom them to be your future students. For the first and/or second graduate student in your group,
you might have to spend extra time teaching them how to develop niche skills needed in your area of
research.
<!--l. 119--><p class="indent" >   Many times students are confused on what they are expected from the PhD studies. They need some rubrics
(just like you do for your tenure) to be able to work toward. One academic rubric set by the Department
is that student should maintain an adequate GPA and pass the preliminary exam. Beyond that, it
is your job to provide realistic research expectations to the student by creating appropriate rubrics
which might be field dependent. The rubrics for getting a PhD in my lab are straightforward: publish
three technical papers to a journal/conferences by the time you graduate. To help planning the paper
submission the timeline is as follows. During their thesis proposal exam (1 year before defense), they should
have paper 1 accepted and paper 2 submitted or close to submission. During their thesis defense, they
should have papers 1 and 2 accepted and paper 3 submitted or close to submission. The criteria for
getting a technical publication is that the work should push the field by introducing a new idea and
supporting it with theoretical and/or experimental work it naturally meets the criterion for a PhD.
Having three novels would lead to three chapters of a PhD thesis. These three chapters along with an
introduction chapter and a conclusion chapter is adequate for a PhD thesis. Since technical papers have gone
through a peer review by experts in the field, the chances of a student failing the PhD exams are
usually minimal if they have adequate good publications. For a Masters student, the rubric could be 1
technical publication to be accepted/submitted/work in progress by the time they appear for these Thesis
defense.
<!--l. 121--><p class="indent" >   These rubrics need not be set in stone and should be modified based on the career goal of the students. For
example, if a PhD student is seeking a teaching position after graduation, they may want to focus on improving
their teaching skills rather than research skills; if a PhD student is seeking an industry position they might want to
have a more hands-on project that may have more depth and qualify as only a single paper; a Masters student may
not be interested in having publications at all. This latter point, the fact that Masters students has limited time and
may not be able to produce publications might deter you to sign up Masters students in your group. But on the
up-side, there is also the possibility that the Masters might be interested in continuing into the PhD with
you. Thus, you might have to gamble on hiring a Masters student into your group as a beginning
investigator.
<!--l. 124--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-11000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Teaching:</span></span>
   Teaching courses to graduate/undergraduate students is a primary requirement even in research intensive
schools. The course load is usually 2 to 4 depending on your research load. Many elite Universities (usually
called R1 or with very high research output) will have only a 2 course per year workload, usually state
or small private universities (usually called R2 or high research output R3 with moderate resaeach
output) will have 4 courses per year, and those in between, other R1 and some R2 with a relatively
high research demand will have 3 courses per year load. New faculty will get 1 course release for the
first 2 or 3 years. You could also buy out courses anytime by adding the cost of cost release to your
grants.
<!--l. 127--><p class="indent" >   Irrespective of the University you work for, very high research or moderate research, bad teaching will definitely
sink any hopes of getting tenure. However, good teaching is not generally rewarded with tenure. Hence aspire to be
an OK teacher who gets close to average or above Department average ratings, but not any more. The time you save
by being an OK teacher should be utilized for research including paper and proposal writing and working with your
graduate students to make them independent.
<!--l. 129--><p class="indent" >   It usually easier to teach core (mandatory) classes with well established textbooks. These textbooks help
immensely in creating notes for teaching and questions/answer keys that can be used for setting up homeworks and
exams. Your goal is to put some effort teaching the course the first time and then try to use that momentum to
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
teach it without using too much time to prepare for it. Thus, its important that you teach the course a couple of
times to justify the effort it took to create the course.
<!--l. 131--><p class="indent" >   Teaching graduate courses and technical electives in your field of expertise can be gratifying. It can also help to
train the students on the research skills needed to be successful in your lab. But this should be done later in your
tenure years as it can be significantly time consuming. Also, courses with a lab component can be challenging and if
you have to develop labs as part of the course, that can be a whole semester lost to teaching. Be wary of such
commitments.
<!--l. 133--><p class="indent" >   One of the most time consuming and least enjoyable aspect of teaching is grading. Its best to get graders or
teaching assistants to help with them. if possible check if the textbook publisher have computer generated
problems that are automatically graded by a software. There are also automated grading softwares such as
<a 
href="https://gradescope.com" >https://gradescope.com/</a> that enable efficient grading and seem to be available in many Universities. These
softwares work best with multiple choice questions and more generally where students submit the final
answer in a box that can be read using OCR and graded for accuracy. Try to maximize these kinds of
problems.
<!--l. 135--><p class="indent" >   The easiest way to get poor rating (and many instructors do this mistake) is not having clearing grading rubrics.
Use the syllabus to setup clear rubrics for grading (e.g., 20% for homework, 40% for project, and 40% for exams)
and indicate in details your class policies for each of these items such as deadlines for homework, project
expectations, due dates, etc. Post the syllabus in a prominent place where students can download and read it. This
is usually the website Blackboard or Canvas for most. At any cost, dont change the rubrics midway in the
course, but follow them closely. Dont introduce different grading system or cancel exams. It will not
help. If you anticipate changing anything put a clause in the syllabus which gives you the authority
to change, but this practise is best avoided. The only time I had to do a major changes was during
Covid, but other than that I have stuck to the rubrics I set in the syllabus at the beginning of the
semester.
<!--l. 138--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a

class="cmbx-10">Service:</span></span>
   All faculty members are supposed to do some service toward their community and school. However, as a tenure
track faculty you are often given a role to do service in some Department committee. If you have a choice, find a
committee that does as little work as possile. One example is the seminar committee whose job is to solicit seminar
speakers from faculty and coordinate the visit. Another one is the awards committee where your job is to meet at
the end of the semester or year to decide who will get the teaching and/or research and/or service awards. It is
highly advisable against being on a time consuming committees such as undergraduate / graduate committees or
accreditation committees.
<!--l. 141--><p class="indent" >   You are also expected to do some service toward your research community such as review papers, serve on review
panels, serve as a session chair for a conference. These are usually more enjoyable and professionally driven and can
help you network and be known in your research community.

class="cmbx-10">Writing recommendation letters for students:</span></span>
   One of you responsibilities is to write letters of recommendation for students who took your courses or worked
with you on research and/or thesis. It is upto you to agree or disagree to write such letters. I usually dont say &#8216;No&#8217;
to any student who did reasonably well in one of the courses with me and who asks me for a letter. A
recommendation letter needs to be on the Department/College/University letterhead and needs your
signature. The body contains a generic statement about the nature of your recommendation (strong/not
strong), a paragraph introducing you (or you could make this a footer on the last page), and 2 or 3
paragraphs about the person for whom you are writing the letter. Letters for students who were in your
class and with whom you had minimal interaction can be short but letters for students who worked
extensively with you and produced papers or salient outputs tend to be longer. If you can&#8217;t say anything
good about the student, you should refrain from writing the letter instead of writing a bad letter of
recommendation.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<!--l. 146--><p class="indent" >   These letters can become a time sink. But here are some general ideas that might help you speed up the process
of writing these letters. I save all my letters in folders (e.g., internship, graduate studies, postdoc) so that I can reuse
parts of the letters. For students (graduate and undergraduate) who have just a class with me and did reasonably
well, the letters are short. These don&#8217;t take much time to write. For students who have been involved in a more
intense research experience with me, the letter is more detailed with concrete examples on how their work is novel
and/or interesting.
<!--l. 148--><p class="indent" >   Ask your colleagues to give you the letter head they use for recommendation letters. You can then
customize it as needed (e.g., some headers might require you to add you contact details). You should also
have a softcopy of your signature that you can embed in the letter without having the need to print
it out and then sign it by hand. Avoid sending the letter to the students, but directly submit them
to the admission portal (for grad applications) or the contact person (for postdoc applications and
internships
<!--l. 150--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-14000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Letter writers for your tenure:</span></span>
   At the end of 5-years you will have to give the names of potential letters for your tenure application. Ideally you
should give about 3 to 5 potential letter writers. Its a good idea to email these people and ask them
if they would be comfortable writing a letter for you before you give their names. The Department
head will only pick 2 or 3 from your list, but will seek 2 or 3 additional letter writers in your research
area.
<!--l. 153--><p class="indent" >   These letter writers have to be full professors in schools that have reputation as much as your current school or
more. However, these people cannot be your advisors and co-authors on papers or proposals. Associate professors
are generally not recommended. Also, full professors in a different country (even if the University there is ranked
higher than yours) is not recommened because they may not be aware of norms and criteria in your
school/country for tenure. You can also indicate people who should not write letters for your tenure case; this is
optional. These could be people who have strong disagreement with your work or have personally
biases.
<!--l. 155--><p class="indent" >   The Department head will send your CV and research/teaching/service statements by early summer.
The letter writers (if they accept) will be expected to submit their lettera by end of Summer or early
Fall.
<!--l. 157--><p class="indent" >   During your 5-years, you should try to find letter writers who can vouch for you. There are couple of ways of
finding full professors: introduce yourself to them in conferences, invite them to your schools to give a seminar, and
organize workshops with them. Also, do not submit papers or proposals with potential letter writers because that
would disqualify them from writing letter for you.

class="cmbx-10">Managing startup/grant monies and setting up the lab:</span></span>
   Besides running your research group, you have the important task of keeping using your startup/grant monies to
pay for students and buy equipment. I highly recommend that you never delegate this activity to anyone as poor
management of funds can lead to catastrophic effects on your ability to support the research activities in your
lab.
<!--l. 162--><p class="indent" >   If you are an experimentalist who needs equipment to get started in your research, it is your top priority to get
the equipment as soon as possible. If the equipment is expensive, typically greater than 100<span 
class="cmmi-10">,</span>000, and if you are in a
public institution, it could take almost a year to get the equipment because of the number of approvals needed at
various stages, so plan accordingly. If you are into computational work, I highly recommend staggering the purchase
of computers/graphical processing units, other electronics, over the period of a few years to avoid
have outdated computing resources. I keep track of all items (ever) purchased in a simple text file so
that even if the lab is disorganized, I can still check my notes to see if an item was ever purchased.
Another strategy is to collect a list of items that you are seeking over time and batch order them
thus saving shipping costs as many vendors will offer free shipping if your orders are above a certain
threshhold.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
<!--l. 164--><p class="indent" >   There are many aspects of purchasing that you will learn as you work with the system. Here are a
few. Most Universities are non-profit and hence tax exempt. That means, they do not pay taxes on
purchases. There is a tax exempt form that can be used to purchase items without paying taxes. You
can use this form if you are buying something for the lab and want to get reimbursed. The startup
money usually has a expiry time, so you want to factor that in during your purchases. There is money
that accrues to you when you get grants through the overhead. Sometimes the College/Department
might provide you incentives to get more of this money if you did special duties (e.g., support senior
design projects, teach an extra course). This money sits in a separate account and never expires and it
is a great way of &#8220;saving for a rainy day&#8221;. Some other funds, such as NSF research experiences for
undergraduates (REU), can only be used to fund undergraduates who are US citizens or US permanent
residents.
<!--l. 166--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-16000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">Running the research lab:</span></span>
   Running a research lab has its own challenges. You have to meet with students atleast once per week to assess
their progress and to provide feedback. Some people prefer a one-on-one meeting while others prefer a group
meeting. We use the latter. We have a shared google slide show, one for each week. Each student puts slides that
talk about the work they did in the last week and work they plan to do in the next week. The online nature of the
slideshow enables us to do a virtual or in-person meeting and/or record the meeting if needed. During the meeting,
one person (usually the PI), opens the slideshow and shares it with others using screenshare. The students present
their work one after the other and listeners give comments. The meeting has a variable end time that depends
on when all the students are done with their presentation. This ensures that everybody has enough
time to present their work and we are not rushed by time. The virtue of having a group meeting is
that if one student is stuck, it is possible to give collective feedback that is often better than that
provided by a single person, the PI. The students have also found that by forcing them to put their
ideas on a slideshow every week helps them to prepare for presentations as they can recycle the slides
and/or get practise. Students often volunteer to give a practise talk befor a conference and/or thesis
presentation.
<!--l. 169--><p class="indent" >   The group meeting is the single most important tool that has helped me keep my lab productive. Besides
research projects, we also talk about other important items such as writing and reading papers, lining up conference
papers/deadlines, tools to help productivity, etc. Since the lab meeting is important, we never cancel it, but
move it a day early or back as needed. But we do break for 2 weeks at the end of the year (i.e., in
December). I avoid keeping the lab meeting on Mon or Fri because those are holidays if it is a long
weekend.
<!--l. 171--><p class="indent" >   We have also found that it is important to have an instant messaging service for the lab. This is often used as a
means for asking others for help (e.g., I cannot find the drill in the lab or I need a certain special wire, do we have it
in the lab?) to sharing interesting ideas and resources. We have tried using the free version of Slack, but it deletes all
history after 90 days. We have moved to Microsoft Teams which is provided for free by the University. We can now
use many of the Teams features such as Meetings, Calendar, and integration with online Excel to manage the lab
meetings.
<!--l. 174--><p class="indent" >   Maintaining the lab research website is an important item. This is how you will get undergraduate and graduate
students interested in your work. You can check my lab website here: <a 
href="tiny.cc/ramlab" >tiny.cc/ramlab</a>. Note that I am using a URL
shortener. The advantage of the shortened link is that if I change the domain of the website, I can change
the underlying link without having to change the shortened URL. If you skim my lab website, you
will see that I keep a track of publications, funding, and lab alumni. I think these are the three most
important items on a lab website. I also have a &#8220;videos&#8221; page that has lots of research outputs in
terms of videos. This eye candy helps to attract new students by giving them visual information that
is easy to process. I update the website about 3 times per year, once after each term, Fall, Spring,
and Summer. This is the reason why I dont have a &#8220;News&#8221; page which needs constant updating. I
maintain an &#8220;undergraduate alumni&#8221; page on which I have put reports/code links with the specific
research experience (e.g., Senior Design, Undergraduate Research). This kind of information sharing helps
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
future stduents who might want to understand the type of projects done in the lab. The &#8220;Contact&#8221;
page not only gives the address to my lab, but also parking and navigation information. This is very
helpful if you want to tell a visitor where you are located without the need to typing it out every single
time.

class="cmbx-10">Curriculum Vitae (CV):</span></span>
   You should strive to keep your CV up-to-date. This is the single most important document that will help you to
track your important achievements. The CV is sent out to your letter writers and it might also be used in tenure
decision by your Department/College/University. The CV if structured properly can drammatically help the letter
writers to write compeling letters and the committee members to vote in support for granting you tenure. Besides
the standard experience/education items, you can make it easier for them by including items that they can used to

     easy to distinguish. You can underline your graduate/undergraduate students in the publication list to

   You have not earned tenure till you get an official letter to that effect from the highest person in the University
system, the Chancellor or the President. Also, your appointment as tenured Associate Professor does not start till
the beginning of the academic year of Fall of year 7, so you might factor that in before announcing it to the world
and updating your CV/profile on Linkedin etc. For most schools, earning tenure means you have a job for life; you
cannot be fired unless the school goes south and closes down and/or you do something unethical. Some of the things
that open up for you are:
