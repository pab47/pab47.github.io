class="cmbx-10">&#x00A0;Some basics before you start:</span></span>
     If you are straight out of school with a PhD or have some post-doc experience, it is important
     to understand the differences between the workload of a PhD/postdoc versus a faculty
     member.
     <!--l. 61--><p class="noindent" >As a postdoc/PhD student, your responsibilities are: to read literature, perform research and write up
     your work, attend conferences and give talks, and occasionally, you might have to mentor undergraduate
     or newer graduate students. But as a faculty member your responsibilities increase several fold: you have
     to generate new research ideas, perform research (atleast in the beginning), write papers and proposals,
     setup a budget, manage funded proposal ensuring that you are spending appropriately, hiring and
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     advising graduate and undergraduate students, setting up an running a research lab, providing
     service to your community by reviewing papers, proposals, and to department committees,
     attending and giving talks at conferences, networking with other faculty, writing letters of
     recommendation, ordering lab supplies, and so on. But like the PhD/postdoc student,
     you have the same 24 hours and perhaps increasing family responsibilities. In summary,
     you have many more things on your plate as a faculty member. Hence, prioritizing and
     delegating work and being more efficient with your time are of paramount importance to be
     successful.
     <!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >The tenure track job is like a startup but a lot safer because 1) you are guaranteed a salary for the first 6
     years, 2) the chances of success are quite high, typically 75% or more compared to only 10% for a
     startup, 3) it is quite well-known what is needed to succeed at a tenure track and is by far much more
     controllable unlike a startup where the things are unclear and to a great extent out of your control;
     timing and luck matter a lot.
     <!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" >As a faculty member running a lab, the research is going to be performed by graduate students in your
     lab. They are going to be the backbone of your research, which determines the impact you will have on
     the field. While the top R1 Universities generally attract top talent from within and outside the United
     States, it is always challenging for R2, R3, and even mid- and low-ranked R1 schools to attract the same
     talent. Because you are just starting, recruiting good students is going to be even harder
     for you if you are not in a top R1 University. This has to be the most important factor
     you take into account when you plan the years leading to your tenure; you need a feasible
     research plan that you and your students can execute in the limited time available at your
     disposal.

class="cmbx-10">&#x00A0;Tenure Timeline:</span></span>
     The tenure track clock is shorter than you think: it is 5 years and not 6 years. If you join in Fall
     (August) of Year 1, under normal circumstances (There are two exceptions: 1) You got a
     maternity/paternity leave for a semester or two, which will extend it by a year; 2) You started in Spring
     (January) instead of Fall, which will give you two extra semesters, Spring and Summer),
     you will submit your tenure package in Fall of Year 5 and submit recommendation letter
     writers to the Head of the Department in the Summer of Year 4. There will be at least one
     mid-tenure review, either at the end of Spring of Year 2 or Fall/Spring of Year 3. During
     the Fall of Year 6, your tenure package will undergo voting at various levels: first in the
     Department, then at the College, and then at the University, eventually making it to the
     President/Chancellor/Board of Regents for their approval. Most schools let you know the status
     of the vote at various levels. If you are successful, you will be promoted with indefinite
     tenure as an Associate Professor in the Fall of Year 7. If you are not successful, you will
     have a year, that is, from the Fall of Year 7 to the end of Spring Year 7, to find another
     job.
<a 
 id="x1-3001r3"></a>
     <!--l. 71--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-4000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">3.</span><span 
class="cmbx-10">&#x00A0;Rubrics for earning tenure:</span></span>
     Your tenure package will be evaluated on a set of rubrics for research, teaching, and service. So let&#8217;s start
     with the end in mind. What are the evaluation rubrics?
     <!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >Unfortunately, these rubrics are never quantitatively defined by the University/College/Department in
     any concrete form. However, the rubrics are informally communicated within the Department circles.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     You could check this with the recently tenured associate professors or non-tenured assistant professors
     who are further ahead on the academic clock. For most research-intensive, mid-ranked Universities, the
     rubrics for securing tenure in Engineering are about the same. They are in the order of decreasing
     difficulty (in my opinion):
    <ol  class="enumerate1" >
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-4002x1">
    <!--l. 76--><p class="noindent" >Publish around 2 technical papers every year, or about 10 papers when you go up for tenure.
    The majority of these should be with your students.
    </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-4004x2">
    <!--l. 77--><p class="noindent" >Win one federal grant as the Principal Investigator. Some Universities may require you to
    secure another grant as a PI or co-PI.
    </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-4006x3">
    <!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" >At least one PhD student from your lab has to be close to graduation.
    </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-4008x4">
    <!--l. 79--><p class="noindent" >Teach   courses   assigned   to   you   with   an   average   rating   close   to   that   of   your
    Department/College or average.
    </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-4010x5">
    <!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >Serve on at least one Department Committee and serve your research community in some
    capacity, such as reviewing papers or proposals.
    </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-4012x6">
    <!--l. 81--><p class="noindent" >Be able to recommend 3-5 full professors who can write a strong letter for your tenure case.</li></ol>
     <!--l. 83--><p class="noindent" >In a nutshell, the point of the tenure process is for the College/University to be able to judge your ability
     to run a sustainable research program (hiring students, raising money, writing papers), teach courses
     (which helps to generate tuition revenue), and provide service to the Department and to your research
     community.
     <!--l. 85--><p class="noindent" >If you changed jobs, that is, you moved from one University to another, it is highly likely that your
     research, teaching, and service contributions will not transfer to the new University; you would need to
     start from scratch unless you negotiated transferring some research credits to your new job. There are
     two exceptions: 1) If you are able to transfer your unspent grants to the new University,
     you will get full credit for the transferred grant. 2) If your graduate students are willing
     to move with you to the new University, then the majority of their coursework should
     transfer, provided you negotiated the transfer of students. Getting research-ready students to
     transfer will help you jump-start your research program and also help set up your new lab.
     When I moved mid-tenure, I was able to transfer two NSF grants as well as 4 graduate
     students. This gave me a great head start at the new University on my second tenure track
     job.

class="cmbx-10">&#x00A0;Planning your tenure track timeline:</span></span>
     It&#8217;s not only important to focus on what to do, but also when to do it. Here is an overview of the
     timing
    <ol  class="enumerate1" >
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5002x1">
    <!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline">Publications:</span> It takes six months to a year to formulate, solve, and write up a new project.
    It will take another six months to a year to get it published (i.e., resubmitted or accepted
    paper does not count; it has to be published). Thus, it takes at least a year (a conservative
    estimate) to get a publication out. Given that you need at least 2 publications per year,
    you need to be working on 2-3 papers every year. This also means that you need to start
    publishing a sizeable number of papers early, in years 1 to 4, to ensure that the papers are
    published by the time you go up for tenure. Thus, expect to be busy working on research
    and publications throughout the five years.
    </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5004x2">
    <!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline">Grants:</span> New faculty have startups which last for the first 3 years. A standard startup will
    include monies for student support and equipment. Thus, you need to hit grants starting
    in year 3. A good strategy is to work on grant writing skills by attending workshops in the
    first two years, submit just enough proposals (say 3 <span 
class="cmsy-10">- </span>4) in those years, and peak in terms
    of quantity and quality of grants in years three and four. By focusing on research from year
    1, you are able to generate preliminary results to support your proposal ideas.
    </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5006x3">
    <!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline">Hiring and Training PhD students:</span> Incoming PhD students take mandatory coursework,
    which helps them prepare for the preliminary exam at the end of the first year. You
    can&#8217;t expect incoming PhD students to produce research products in the first year. It
    may take them another year to produce publishable research. This means that you
    need to hire PhD students as soon as possible. But if you join in the Fall, you have
    a big disadvantage because you might have to wait till the following Spring to get
    your first PhD student; PhD applicants get accepted around mid-April. This implies
    that, realistically, you can get a publication from your first PhD students in year 3
    onwards. But you cannot afford to wait to publish in year 3; that&#8217;s too late. Thus, you
    need to find a shortcut to hire students and start publishing early. Here are some
    strategies
        <ol  class="enumerate2" >
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5008x1">
        <!--l. 97--><p class="noindent" >Hire MS students into your research group. MS students who have completed their
        coursework can be relatively quickly turned into research-productive graduate students
        compared to new PhD students. Try to solicit MS students in your major to join your
        research group by paying them tuition and/or a stipend.
        </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5010x2">
        <!--l. 98--><p class="noindent" >Hire research productive MS students into the PhD program. Ask other professors to
        recommend their MS students. These students have completed their coursework and
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
        have some experience with research. This boosts your research productivity very quickly.
        You could also hire PhD students who are looking to move from one group to another,
        but be careful about this choice, as these students could be problematic; check with
        their PhD advisors and interview them before you make the call.
        </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5012x3">
        <!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" >Send out unpublished work from your PhD and postdoc for publication. You might have
        some results from your PhD or postdoc that need some analysis to turn into publishable
        work. Get these out in the first two years.
        </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5014x4">
        <!--l. 100--><p class="noindent" >Hire postdocs. It is rare for beginning investigators to hire postdocs, but if this is viable,
        then it can help boost productivity in the first two years. But note that postdocs are
        generally twice as expensive to support compared to PhD students.</li></ol>
    </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5016x4">
    <!--l. 103--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline">Teaching:</span> As a new faculty, you will get a course release for the first 2 to 3 years.
    For example, if the regular course load is 3 courses per year, then you will teach two
    courses in the first 3 years and 3 courses per year after that. In the 5 years leading up
    to the tenure, expect to be asked to teach at least 4 unique courses, one of which
    would be a graduate course in your field of expertise. For undergraduate courses,
    try to stick to courses that are close to your research field. It is to your advantage
    to teach core classes with prescribed texts and question banks rather than teaching
    elective courses with no prescribed texts, as these require you to develop your own
    notes from reading multiple sources. Try to stagger teaching new courses so that you
    are only teaching one new course per year. Stick to the same 4 courses till you earn
    tenure.
    </li>
<li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5018x5">
    <!--l. 105--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline">Service:</span> You are required to provide some service to your Department and to your research
    community. Your goal is to find the minimum threshold and stick to it for the 5 years leading to
    tenure. Choose a Department committee that requires minimal effort on your part (2-3 meetings
    in the semester). My favorites are the Seminar committee, which meets 1-2 times
    per year to solicit external speakers for the Department seminars, and the Awards
    committee, which meets once per year to decide teaching/service awards. Service to
    your research community could be done by reviewing a few (2-5) papers per year
    and/or serving on proposal panels, which also helps you to learn about the review
    process.</li></ol>
<a

     <!--l. 109--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-6000"></a><span 
class="cmbx-10">5.</span><span 
class="cmbx-10">&#x00A0;Making it easier to complete your tenure package:</span></span>
     At the end of the five years (and sometimes for the mid-tenure review), you will have to submit a
     package, usually in a PDF format, in which you will have to document all things you have
     done.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     <!--l. 112--><p class="noindent" >It&#8217;s easy to forget your contributions unless you keep track of these things as they are achieved. I
     recommend three specific things. (1) Capture your achievements in your Curriculum Vitae (CV). If it&#8217;s
     too much work to constantly update the CV, then I recommend capturing these achievements in
     a text file (e.g., on the desktop) and updating the CV once per month. (2) Capture the
     papers/proposals/review invitation, etc., on your computer. I recommend creating a folder on your
     computer, say &#8220;my_tenure&#8221;. Within that, create folders for every academic year and within that keep
     documents pertaining to grants, papers, teaching review, and service. (3) Understand what is expected in
     the tenure package as early as possible and collect evidence in support of it. All the information on how
     and what to submit as part of your tenure package is freely available for download on
     the University website. Skim through the tenure requirement package to understand what
     things need to be captured. You will be amazed to know how many details are needed. For
     example, for teaching, you are expected to keep track of the number of students who signed
     up for the course, the number of course evaluations you got, and your course evaluation
     rating. For advising, you have to keep track of the number of PhD/MS committees that
     you served on, including the names of the PhD/MS candidates and sometimes the title
     of their thesis. Such things are tedious to track if you don&#8217;t capture them at the right
     time.

class="cmbx-10">6.</span><span 
class="cmbx-10">&#x00A0;Writing proposals:</span></span>
     Writing proposals and winning grants is one of the hardest requirements because: 1) writing proposals is
     a new endeavor for early-career faculty and you have to learn it on the fly while juggling other
     responsibilities, and 2) the success rate on federal grants is very low, <span 
class="cmsy-10">~ </span>5 <span 
class="cmsy-10">- </span>20%. The solution to 1) is to
     go through some formal grant writing workshop or books to learn about the tricks of grant writing, and
     the solution to 2) is to write as many quality grants as possible while maintaining a decent research
     portfolio.
     <!--l. 117--><p class="noindent" >Although it is expected to win at least one federal grant, it is a good idea to write other
     local, state, or industry-related proposals, at least in the early stages of your career. This
     exercise gives you some practice to tackle the harder, longer, and more competitive federal
     grants.

     <!--l. 121--><p class="noindent" >A federal grant is about 15 <span

     things that you are going to do over 3 to 5 years. But you also need some preliminary
     work to support your studies. The preliminary work can come from your past published or
     unpublished work. The preliminary work is usually a simulation study or a small subset of
     experiments that you are proposing. It is important to keep this in mind while performing your
     research.
     <!--l. 123--><p class="noindent" >Assuming you have a great idea and preliminary work to support your proposed research, I recommend

     To make tenure, you need to win at least one federal grant as a Principal Investigator.
     But the catch is that if you win a grant, you cannot stop writing proposals. This will look
     questionable on your CV. Thus, you have to keep writing proposals to demonstrate that
     you are continually putting in the effort to raise money to support your research. Also,
     given the low success rate in funding, it is important to submit many proposals. In fact,
     it is highly recommended that you always have 1-2 proposals under review at any given
     time.
     <!--l. 131--><p class="noindent" >So, how do you keep a steady stream of proposals going out, given that writing a proposal can be a time
     sink? Note that not all proposals are the same. This is the most important fact that you can exploit to
     diversify your portfolio. For example, NSF proposals are limited to 15 pages, some state-level proposals
     might have a proposal template, and many Department of Defense submissions require you to write a
     white paper that can be 2 to 5 pages long. Thus, in any given year, you can mix the types of grants and
     agencies you apply for funding. You can also improve and resubmit rejected proposals. You could take a
     given tool and apply it to a different application and submit it to a different agency (e.g.,
     collaborative robotics can have applications in security, which is funded by the Department
     of Homeland Security, and also in agricultural research, which is funded by the National
     Institute of Food and Agriculture). You could also collaborate with another PI, both of you
     submit two proposals to different agencies, and each one takes up the majority of the writing
     task.
     <!--l. 134--><p class="noindent" >As an early-career-faculty (The definition of early career faculty varies. One definition
     is based on terminal degree, e.g., 10 years from the PhD degree. Another one is by the
     job, e.g., untenured Assistant Professor) you have access to special programs e.g, NSF
     CAREER award, DoD Young Investigator Program (YIP) that give you a smaller pool to
     compete with. These are prestigious grants, and getting these awards could potentially lead
     to tenure if other aspects of your package meet the minimum expectations. Sometimes a
     University/College might have internal grants to help early-career faculty. These grants are small, but
     they help you get started with fundraising and generating preliminary data for external
     proposals. There are some programs that depend on the designation of your University,
     e.g., HBCU, MSI, EPSCoR. There are certain opportunities called limited submissions,
     which means that only a set number of applications (usually 1 or 2) may go out from one
     University. These usually involve an internal competition, but they would have a smaller
     competition pool if you succeed at the University level. As an early career faculty, it is best to
     avoid submitting to large, multi-university, multi-PI opportunities and equipment grants
     unless there are special circumstances (e.g., research cannot be done without a specific
     instrument).

     The normal expectation is that you publish 2 papers per year in journals/conferences in your field. While
     the time to acceptance in conferences is generally shorter, 3-6 months, journals can take 6 months to a
     year or more for the first decision. Also, in some of the more traditional fields in engineering, conference
     papers are not counted as full papers. This means that based on your field, you have to factor
     in the time needed from submitting to publication in the conference proceedings and/or
     journals. It is always a good idea to have at least 1-2 papers under review at any given
     time.
     <!--l. 141--><p class="noindent" >It is important to send out papers as soon as you start your tenure-track position. It is a good idea to
     use your PhD/postdoc work as a basis for these papers. To count as a publication, your affiliation
     on the paper should be your current institution. Also, as you are working on setting up
     your lab and hiring new students, it is important to send out a steady stream of papers.
     This can be done by resorting to theoretical/simulation work if that is possible. If you are
     into experimental work, there is no other way other than to set up your lab quickly and
     perhaps do the experiments yourself, as it takes a year or two for the graduate students to be
     productive.
     <!--l. 143--><p class="noindent" >The initial few years are the hardest because you have to not only set up your lab, but also write
     proposals, and hire students. It&#8217;s best that you don&#8217;t take any risky projects but focus on relatively safe
     projects, which would likely lead to publishable work. Keep the risky projects for later, possibly after
     earning tenure.
     <!--l. 145--><p class="noindent" >In my first tenure-track job (5 years), my lab published a total of 33 papers that included 13 journal
     papers. I chose to work in an area that was close to my PhD work on trajectory optimization for legged
     robots and focused on extensive simulations for generating publishable work, which is considered a safer
     bet. In my second tenure-track job, when I submitted my tenure package, my lab had a total of 33
     papers that included 12 journal papers. In addition to my core area of legged robotics, I ventured into a
     new area of combinatorial optimization and vehicle routing. I was able to do extensive hardware
     validation in addition to simulation in legged robotics, which is something I always wanted to do.
     Reflecting back, the first 5 years (first TT job) were the hardest, where I wrote most of the 33
     papers and also did quite a bit of research for some of them. However, the second 5 years
     (second TT job), it was much easier; I wrote a few papers in their entirety, but was largely
     involved in the overall direction of the work and editing/commenting on the student-written
     papers.

class="cmbx-10">&#x00A0;Recruiting and Training PhD students:</span></span>
     Having a successful PhD student(s) as you go up for tenure is sometimes a norm for earning
     tenure (for non-PhD granting departments, there might be a requirement to supervise MS
     thesis students). Here &#8220;success&#8221; usually means that the student has at least passed the
     thesis proposal examination, which indicates that the student is well on the way to a PhD
     degree.
     <!--l. 152--><p class="noindent" >A good student can be a multiplier, which just doubles or triples your output for research, but a bad
     student can be a time sink. Thus, it is important to recruit good students to your group. This is
     something that comes from experience, and everybody whom I know has failed to some extent, so don&#8217;t
     overthink, but go by your instinct. Some of the tips are: try to hire alumni from schools that have been
     successful in your program, connect with friends/colleagues in other schools and ask them to recommend
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     their students, hire undergraduate students at your institution, and groom them to be your future
     students. For the first and/or second graduate student in your group, you might have to
     spend extra time teaching them how to develop niche skills needed in your area of research.
     Then these students can train the next set of students that you hire in your group. In
     my group, I try to give more attention to new students to help them flesh out a research
     problem, solve it, and then write it up. There are certain easy conferences in my field, which I
     encourage new students to publish in the first year or two. Once they have their first paper
     published, the goal is to publish in a more competitive venue relative to the last one, and so
     on.
     <!--l. 154--><p class="noindent" >New students are often confused about what they are expected to do during their PhD studies. They
     need general guidelines. But you can really help them by explicitly spelling out clear rubrics for the Phd.
     The Department-wide rubrics are that students should maintain a certain minimum GPA (usually 3.5 on
     a scale of 4.0 or above) and pass the preliminary exams within two tries. Beyond that, it is your job to
     provide realistic research expectations to the student by creating appropriate rubrics, which
     might be field-dependent. The rubrics for getting a PhD in my lab are straightforward:
     publish three technical papers in a journal/conference by the time you graduate. To help
     plan the paper submission, the timeline is as follows. During their thesis proposal exam (1
     year before defense), they should have paper 1 accepted and paper 2 submitted or close to
     submission. During their thesis defense, they should have papers 1 and 2 accepted and paper 3
     submitted or close to submission. The criteria for getting a technical publication are that the
     work should push the field by introducing a new idea and supporting it with theoretical
     and/or experimental work, which naturally meets the criterion for a PhD. These three
     papers, which indicate three novel contributions, can be recycled as three chapters of a PhD
     thesis. These three chapters, along with an introduction chapter and a conclusion chapter,
     are adequate to be awarded a PhD degree. Since technical papers have gone through a
     peer review by experts in the field, the chances of a student failing the PhD exams after
     getting 3 papers accepted are usually minimal. For a Master&#8217;s student, the rubric could be 1
     technical publication to be accepted/submitted/work in progress by the time they appear
     for the Thesis defense. Note that publishing the PhD work in a journal or conference is
     never required in most programs. However, for the student to be competitive in the job
     market, having a technical publication has become a necessity. The students who aspire to be
     faculty members after graduation will have more than 3 papers accepted by the time they
     graduate.
     <!--l. 156--><p class="noindent" >These rubrics need not be set in stone and should be modified based on the career goals of the students.
     For example, if a PhD student is seeking a teaching position after graduation, they may want to focus on
     improving their teaching skills by becoming instructors rather than working on research projects; if a
     PhD student is seeking an industry position they might want to have a more hands-on
     project that may have more depth and end up publishing only a single paper; a Masters
     student may not be interested in having publications at all. This latter point, the fact that
     Master&#8217;s students have limited time and may not be able to produce publications, might
     deter you from signing up Master&#8217;s students for your group. But on the upside, there is the
     possibility that the Masters might be interested in continuing into the PhD with you. Thus,
     you might have to gamble on hiring a Master&#8217;s student into your group as a beginning
     investigator.
     <!--l. 158--><p class="noindent" >Once you have a few graduate students working in your lab, you need to figure out if you want to assign
     individual projects or group projects. The advantage of individual projects is that one student can
     control the pace of the project without getting slowed down by others, but if you have a strong
     group with complementary skills (e.g., hardware engineering and software engineering), then
     group projects might be required to enable speedy progress. For group projects, you have
     to be careful about who takes the lead role in the research and, consequently, the first
     authorship on the resulting paper. In my research group, students have their individual
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     research projects that they take on. But it is up to them to seek collaboration from others
     in the lab or not. Some students do end up working in groups, and some others prefer
     to work individually, and this seems to have worked well for me without generating any
     conflict.
     <!--l. 160--><p class="noindent" >I started my first tenure-track job in August 2014. I was able to get my first PhD student in 2015.
     I added 2 more students in August 2018 who transferred from the MS program to the
     PhD program. Over the 5 years from 2015-2019, I supervised 9 MS student theses, some of
     whom published at least 1 technical paper. I was also able to get 5 technical papers with
     undergraduate students. When I moved to my second tenure track job, I was able to transfer all
     3 PhD students and a fourth one who moved from another group to mine. Around the
     time I submitted my tenure package, I was advising 6 PhD students and 2 MS theses,
     but I had already graduated 2 PhD students (both were transfer students) and completed
     advising 2 MS Theses. One advantage of moving from an R2 University (first TT job)
     to an R1 University (second TT job) was that I was able to recruit significantly better
     students into my research group, which improved the quality and quantity of publications and
     proposals.

class="cmbx-10">&#x00A0;Teaching:</span></span>
     Teaching courses to graduate/undergraduate students is a primary requirement even in
     research-intensive schools. The course load is usually 2 to 4, depending on your research load. Many elite
     Universities (usually called R1 or with very high research output) will have only a 2 course
     per year workload, usually state or small private universities (usually called R2 or high
     research output R3 with moderate resaeach output) will have 4 courses per year, and those
     in between, other R1 and some R2 with a relatively high research demand will have 3
     courses per year workload. New faculty will get 1 course release for the first 2 or 3 years.
     You could also buy out courses anytime by adding the cost of the course release to your
     grants.
     <!--l. 166--><p class="noindent" >Irrespective of the University you work for, whether a very high research or moderate research
     institution, bad teaching will definitely sink any hopes of getting tenure. However, good teaching is not
     generally rewarded with tenure. Hence, aspire to be an OK teacher who gets close to average or above
     Department average ratings, but not any more. The time you save by being an OK teacher should be
     utilized for research, including paper and proposal writing, and working with your graduate students to
     make them independent researchers; note that independent graduate researchers are like a multiplier to
     your research productivity.
     <!--l. 168--><p class="noindent" >It is usually easier to teach core (mandatory) classes with well-established textbooks. These textbooks
     help immensely in creating notes for teaching and questions/answer keys that can be used for setting up
     homework and exams. Your goal is to put some effort into teaching the course the first
     time and then try to use that momentum to teach it again with minimal time and effort.
     Thus, it&#8217;s important that you teach the course a couple of times to justify the effort it took
     to create the course. It takes me 10 hours per week to prepare and teach a new course.
     This includes the time it takes to learn the material and prepare the homework. But once
     done, it takes me only 5-10 minutes to be ready to teach the lecture material the next
     time.
     <!--l. 170--><p class="noindent" >Teaching graduate courses and technical electives in your field of expertise can be gratifying. It can also
     help to train the students on the research skills needed to be successful in your lab. But this should be
     done later in your tenure years, as it can be significantly time-consuming. Courses with a lab component
     can be particularly challenging, and if you have to develop labs as part of the course, that can be a whole
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     semester lost to teaching. Be wary of such commitments. All that said, I did develop a new course on
     Mechatronics with a lab component in my first year on my first tenure track job. I had no choice because
     I was hired to teach that course, and the lab part of the course was in really bad shape.
     Since then, I have taught it multiple times and also added more labs. You can see it here
     <a 
href="https://tiny.cc/mechatronix" >https://tiny.cc/mechatronix</a>.
     <!--l. 172--><p class="noindent" >You can expect to teach about 3 (2 courses per year workload) to 5 (4 courses per year workload) new
     courses during your tenure track years. Generally, one of these courses will be a technical
     elective in your field of expertise. Try to stagger these courses so that you are taking up
     teaching a new course every year instead of every semester. When teaching the course for the
     very first time, try to meet the minimum requirements; you can always up the ante as
     you teach it the second and third time. Once you develop notes for a new course, try to
     teach it as many times as you can to save time. In my first tenure track job, I taught 4
     new courses. In my second tenure track job, I taught 7 new courses, but 3 of them were
     already developed during my first tenure track job. I also had ample experience teaching
     new courses that I ventured to record and make my courses freely available on the web:

     <!--l. 175--><p class="noindent" >One of the most time-consuming and least enjoyable aspects of teaching is grading. It&#8217;s best to get
     graders or teaching assistants to help with them. If possible, check if the textbook publisher has
     computer-generated problems that are automatically graded by software. There are also
     automated grading software such as <a 
href="https://gradescope.com" >https://gradescope.com/</a> that enable efficient grading
     and seem to be available in many Universities free of cost. This software works best with
     multiple-choice questions and, more generally, where students submit the final answer in a
     box that can be read using OCR and graded for accuracy. Once graded, the scores can
     be transferred to your course management tools (e.g., Blackboard) with a few clicks. It&#8217;s
     only most recently that I have started to capitalize on this tool to assign multiple-choice
     questions and put text boxes for students to input their answers. This has cut down grading
     time substantially. To give you an idea, check out this video at Time 2min 09 seconds
     <a

     <!--l. 177--><p class="noindent" >The easiest way to get a poor rating (and many instructors make this mistake) is not having clear
     grading rubrics or not following the grading rubrics. Use the syllabus to set up clear rubrics for grading
     (e.g., 20% for homework, 40% for project, and 40% for exams) and indicate in detail your class policies
     for each of these items, such as due dates for homework, project expectations, missed exam policy, etc.
     Post the syllabus in a prominent place where students can download and read it. This is usually a
     learning management software, such as Blackboard or Canvas, for most universities. At any cost,
     don&#8217;t change the rubrics midway in the course, but follow them closely. Don&#8217;t introduce
     a different grading system or cancel exams. It will not help. If you anticipate changing
     anything, put a clause in the syllabus that gives you the authority to change, but this
     practice is best avoided. The only time I had to make major changes was during COVID, but
     other than that, I have stuck to the rubrics I set in the syllabus at the beginning of the
     semester.

     All faculty members are supposed to do some service toward their community and school. However, as a
     tenure-track faculty, you are often given a role to serve on a Department committee. If you have a choice,
     find a committee that does as little work as possible. One example is the seminar committee, whose job
     is to solicit seminar speakers from faculty and coordinate the visit. Another one is the awards
     committee, where your job is to meet at the end of the semester or year to decide who will get
     the teaching/, research, and/or service awards. It is highly advisable to avoid being on

     enjoyable as they are related to one&#8217;s profession and can help you network in your research
     community.
     <!--l. 184--><p class="noindent" >In my first TT job, where we were a small Department of 25 faculty members, we were
     required to be on 2 Department committees. I served on a combination of search committees,
     seminar committee, accreditation committee, and faculty advisor for a student org. In my
     second TT job, where we were a relatively larger Department of 40+ faculty, I was expected
     to serve on a single committee, the UG recruitment committee, first as a member and
     then as a chair. The work I did for this committee also resonated with my research on
     using robotics to recruit and train students, so it was a good fit in spite of the relatively
     more work that was expected of me. I also served as the faculty advisor for a student org
     involved with robotics, again, a role that is closely connected to my research on robotics I
     served on multiple National Science Foundation (NSF) proposal panels and NSF Graduate
     Research Fellowship (NSF-GRFP) through the 11 years I was a tenure-track professor,
     thus helping me to learn how research and graduate student proposals are reviewed and
     funded. I was also the Associate Editor for two of the biggest IEEE robotics conferences for
     most of these years, and for an ASME journal for 3 years. Though I reviewed almost 20-30
     papers every year in the first 8 years, I have since reduced these reviews to almost negligible
     as I was closer to earning tenure. I also stopped serving as an Associate Editor once I
     submitted my package, and was instead recommended by a former PhD student to that
     role.

class="cmbx-10">&#x00A0;Writing recommendation letters for students:</span></span>
     One of your responsibilities is to write letters of recommendation for students who took your courses or
     worked with you on research and/or thesis. It is up to you to agree or disagree to write such letters. I
     usually don&#8217;t say &#8216;No&#8217; to any student who did reasonably well in one of the courses with me and who
     asks me for a letter. A recommendation letter needs to be on the Department/College/University
     letterhead and needs your signature. The body contains a generic statement about the nature of your
     recommendation (strong/not strong), a paragraph introducing you (or you could make this a footer
     on the last page), and 2 or 3 paragraphs about the person for whom you are writing the
     letter.
     <!--l. 191--><p class="noindent" >These letters can become a time sink. But here are some general ideas that might help you speed up the
     process of writing these letters. I save all my letters in folders (e.g., internship, graduate studies, postdoc,
     jobs) so that I can reuse parts of the letters. For students (graduate and undergraduate) who have just
     had a class with me and did reasonably well, the letters are short. These don&#8217;t take much time to write.
     For students who have been involved in a more intense research experience with me, the letter
     is more detailed with concrete examples on how their work is novel and/or interesting.
     If you can&#8217;t say anything good about the student, you should refrain from writing the
     letter.
     <!--l. 193--><p class="noindent" >Ask your colleagues to give you the letterhead they use for recommendation letters. You can then
     customize it as needed (e.g., some headers might require you to add your contact details). You should
     also have a soft copy of your signature that you can embed in the letter without having the need to print
     it out and then sign it by hand. Avoid sending the letter to the students, but directly submit it to the
     admission portal (for grad applications) or the contact person (for postdoc applications and

class="cmbx-10">&#x00A0;Letter writers for your tenure:</span></span>
     At the start of the summer of Year 4, you will have to give the names of potential letters for your tenure
     application. Ideally, you should give about 3 to 5 potential letter writers. It&#8217;s a good idea to email these
     people and ask them if they would be comfortable writing a letter for you before you give their
     names. The Department head will only pick 2 or 3 from your list, but will seek 2 or 3
     additional letter writers in your research area. In my case, I emailed 6 full professors to see if
     they would be willing to write me a tenure letter. Two of them had other obligations that
     summer, and they declined. The remaining 4 agreed, and I sent out their names to the
     Department head while indicating the names of the other 2 who had declined based on other
     commitments.
     <!--l. 198--><p class="noindent" >These letter writers have to be full professors in schools that have a reputation as strong as your current
     school or better. However, these people cannot be your advisors and co-authors on papers or proposals.
     Associate professors and senior personnel in industry are generally not recommended. Also, full
     professors in a different country (even if the University there is ranked higher than yours) is not
     recommended because they may not be aware of the norms and criteria in your school/country for
     tenure. You can also indicate people who should not write letters for your tenure case; this is optional.
     These could be people who have strong disagreements with your work or have personal
     biases.
     <!--l. 200--><p class="noindent" >The Department head will send your CV and research/teaching/service statements by early summer.
     The letter writers (if they accept) will be expected to submit their letters by the end of Summer or early
     Fall.
     <!--l. 202--><p class="noindent" >During your 5 years, you should try to find letter writers who can vouch for you. There are a couple of
     ways of finding full professors: introduce yourself to them at conferences, invite them to your school to
     give a seminar, and organize workshops with them. Also, do not submit papers or proposals
     with potential letter writers because that would disqualify them from writing a letter for
     you. Almost all of my 6 potential letter writers, except one, knew me from my PhD days
     through conferences. So I did not have a need to invite full Professors to give a seminar
     at my school. I used the seminar opportunity to call Assistant Professors who worked in
     similar areas to learn more about their research and introduce them to the students in my
     lab.

    to justify why your chosen supplier is the most cost-effective supplier. All these things take
    time, usually 6 months or more.

    <!--l. 213--><p class="noindent" >Most Universities are non-profit and hence tax-exempt. That means they do not pay taxes
    on purchases. There is a tax-exempt form that can be used to purchase items without
    paying taxes. You can use this form if you are buying something for the lab and want
    to get reimbursed (e.g., lunch with a seminar speaker). If you don&#8217;t use this form to get
    tax-exemption, you may not be able to get reimbursed for the taxes. For low-priced items,
    I don&#8217;t bother with the tax exemption form, just absorb the taxes myself.

    <!--l. 215--><p class="noindent" >When you have funded grants, a part of the overhead comes back to you via the Indirect

class="cmsy-10">- </span>5% of the overhead. It&#8217;s
    not a lot of money unless you have really big grants. This money never expires. You can
    use this for any purchases, including equipment, graduate support, and summer salary. In
    my opinion, it goes the longest way if you use it for equipment, as that has no taxes, then
    graduate support, and finally your salary, as the taxes for graduate students are a lot less
    than your salary.

class="cmbx-10">&#x00A0;Running the research lab:</span></span>
     Running a research lab has its own challenges. You have to meet with students at least once per week to
     assess their progress and to provide feedback. Some people prefer a one-on-one meeting while others
     prefer a group meeting. We use the latter. We have a shared Google Slides show, one for each week. Each
     student puts slides that talk about the work they did in the last week and the work they plan to do in
     the next week. The online nature of the slideshow enables us to do a virtual or in-person meeting
     and/or record the meeting if needed. During the meeting, one person (usually the PI)
     opens the slideshow and shares it with others using screenshare. The students present their
     work one after the other, and the listeners give comments. The meeting has a variable
     end time that depends on when all the students are done with their presentations. This
     ensures that everybody has enough time to present their work, and we are not rushed for
     time. The virtue of having a group meeting is that if one student is stuck, it is possible to
     give collective feedback that is often better than that provided by a single person, the PI.
     The students have also found that forcing them to put their ideas on a slideshow every
     week helps them to prepare for presentations as they can recycle the slides and/or get
     practice. Students often volunteer to give a practice talk before a conference and/or thesis
     presentation.
     <!--l. 225--><p class="noindent" >The group meeting is the single most important tool that has helped me keep my lab productive. Besides
     research projects, we also talk about other important items such as writing and reading
     papers, lining up conference papers/deadlines, tools to help productivity, etc. Since the lab
     meeting is important, we never cancel it, but move it a day early or back as needed. But we
     do break for 2 weeks at the end of the year (i.e., in December). I avoid keeping the lab
     meeting on Mon or Fri of the semester because those days are usually holidays if it is a long
     weekend.
     <!--l. 227--><p class="noindent" >We have also found that it is important to have an instant messaging service for the lab. This is often
     used as a means for asking others for help (e.g., I cannot find the drill in the lab or I need a certain
     special wire, do we have it in the lab?) to sharing interesting ideas and resources. We have tried using
     the free version of Slack, but it deletes all history after 90 days. We have moved to Microsoft
     Teams, which is provided for free by the University. We can now use many of the Teams
     features, such as Meetings, Calendar, and integration with online Excel, to manage the lab
     meetings.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
     <!--l. 230--><p class="noindent" >Maintaining the lab research website is very important, in my opinion. It is a conduit for prospective
     students, graduate or undergraduate, to scroll through your work and understand projects done in your
     lab. You can check my lab website here: <a 
href="https://tiny.cc/ramlab" >https://tiny.cc/ramlab</a>. Note that I am using a URL shortener.
     The advantage of the shortened link is that if I change the domain of the website, I can change the
     underlying link without having to change the shortened URL. If you skim my lab website, you will see
     that I keep track of publications, funding, and lab alumni. I think these are the three most
     important items on a lab website. I also have a &#8220;videos&#8221; page that has lots of research outputs
     in terms of videos. This eye candy helps to attract new students by giving them visual
     information that is easy to process. I update the website about 3 times per year, once after
     each term, Fall, Spring, and Summer. This is the reason why I don&#8217;t have a &#8220;News&#8221; page,
     which needs constant updating. I maintain an &#8220;undergraduate alumni&#8221; page on which
     I have put reports/code links with the specific research experience (e.g., Senior Design,
     Undergraduate Research). This kind of information sharing helps future students who might want to
     understand the type of projects done in the lab. The &#8220;Contact&#8221; page not only gives the
     address to my lab, but also parking and navigation information. This is very helpful if you
     want to tell a visitor where you are located without the need to type it out every single
     time.

     You should strive to keep your CV up-to-date. This is the single most important document that will help
     you track your important achievements. The CV is sent out to your letter writers, and it might also be
     used in tenure decisions by your Department/College/University. The CV, if structured properly,
     can dramatically help the letter writers to write compelling letters and the committee
     members to vote in support of granting you tenure. Besides the standard experience/education
     items, you can make it easier for them by including items that they can use to check off on

    <!--l. 267--><p class="noindent" >Try to get a senior faculty member, either an associate or a full professor, to mentor you;
    some Departments/schools have a mentorship program. The mentor should be interested
    in your success and be available to provide you with sound advice. Use the services of the
    mentor when confounded with problems; it will save you a lot of time.

    <!--l. 269--><p class="noindent" >Give students feedback on their progress as often as needed to make them responsible and
    productive. Encourage openness and instill an atmosphere of responsibility and care. There
    should not be politics or favoritism in the lab at any cost (e.g., treat undergraduates with
    the same respect as graduate students)

    <!--l. 270--><p class="noindent" >Try  to  get  leverage  as  much  as  you  can;  this  is  something  that  helps  you  to  be  more
    productive without requiring substantial efforts. If you have a collaborator and you split
    the work of writing papers and proposals, you have 2x the number of papers and proposals
    that you would normally have. If you are able to repurpose a proposal idea by changing the
    application or methods slightly, that gives you leverage. If you can teach the same course a
    couple of times, that is a good leverage, and so on.

    draw schematics with things such as the center of mass, pin joints. I have created a template
    of all such objects in a drawing software called Adobe Illustrator, which I can simply copy
    and paste to make new figures. For creating plots, I have written code that puts out the
    x-y-label, legend, and line type, so I have to do minimal post-processing.

    preparation  time.  But  many  students  don&#8217;t  like  this  approach  unless  you  are  solving
    problems by hand on the PowerPoint. Another popular approach is to use the whiteboard
    or blackboard. With this approach it is next to impossible to post lecture notes after class.
    I use the computer Microsoft Surface Pro, which has a touchscreen and lets me write with a
    pen. I use Microsoft OneNote software to write my notes in real-time in class. I am able to
    output this as a PDF and post it after class. With Microsoft OneNote, I am able to include
    figures/photos/tables into my presentation. Since I use a computer, I am also able to show
    videos and other multimedia in class. I also like that I am able to face the class when writing
    on a computer versus facing a whiteboard.

     year 7, so you might factor that in before announcing it to the world and updating your

     Succeeding on a tenure track is not as hard as it seems. Once you know the rubrics and the timeline, you
     can create and follow a reasonable work plan. It is important that you don&#8217;t burn out during the tenure
